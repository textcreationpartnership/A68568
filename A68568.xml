            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Will a <hi>Dionyſius</hi> become a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in an Vniuerſitie, from among the Athenians? You ſhall finde a <hi>Damaris</hi> to ſecond him.</p>
            <p>In what haue men been renowned, wherein ſome
<pb facs="tcp:1830:3"/> women (according, yea, and beyond the nature of their Sex) haue not been remarkable? in Wiſedome, Faith, Charitie, loue of the Word, loue to Gods Meſſengers, feruent affection, and deſire of heauenly things? If men haue ſuffered impriſonment, cruell perſecution, and Bands for Chriſt, were women behind? No verily, Acts 8. 3. &amp; 9. 2.</p>
            <p>Nay, haue they not in ſomewhat excelled men ſometimes? Who entertained Chriſt ſo much, and ſo often as <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary?</hi> Who are noted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to Chriſts neceſsities, but women? Luk. 8. 3. Who (ſauing <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle) followed Chriſt to his Croſſe, lamenting and weeping, but women? Who of<note place="margin">Luke 24. 24.</note> all the ordinary followers of Chriſt obſerued where Chriſt was buried, but women? Who firſt went to his<note place="margin">Mark. 16. 1, 2.</note> Sepulcher with ſweet ſpices to anoint Chriſts body, but women? We may reade of a Congregation of women,<note place="margin">Acts 16. 13.</note> to whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preached, being gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the accuſtomed place of prayer, as more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as it may ſeeme at that time, then men.</p>
            <p>It would be tedious to repeate by name all the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble women in the holy Scriptures, and their excellent graces; yet can I not let paſſe <hi>Priſcilla</hi> her knowledge with her husband <hi>A quila</hi> in the miniſterie of the Goſpell, able to teach an eloquent <hi>A pollos;</hi> nor <hi>Loys</hi> and <hi>Eunice,</hi> Trayners vp of the famous Euangelist <hi>Timothie</hi> in the holy Scriptures; nor <hi>Perſis,</hi> which<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 3.</note> laboured much in the Lord, as many other women did. Not to ſtand vpon more inſtances, one thing for their more worthy praiſes, is to be obſerued, and not to bee forgotten; I haue read of men well eſteemed of to haue been Apoſtates, as <hi>Demas, Alexander, Phyletus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:1830:4"/> and others; but of neuer a woman by name, once recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the Saints in all the new Teſtament; this is ſingular glorie.</p>
            <p>But the Lord hath not thought it enough to honor women thus, by endowing them with excellent gifts, and by their praiſe-worthy works, but alſo hee hath graced them otherwiſe. To whom did Chriſt firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf after his reſurrection, but vnto women? Of what act did euer Chriſt ſo ſpeake, to make it perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually famous, as that of the woman, that powred vpon<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 7, 17.</note> him an Alabaſter box of oyntment, promiſing that whereſoeuer the Goſpell ſhould bee preached in the whole world, there ſhould her worke bee remembred? Hath not alſo the Lord directed his Penmen, and by name his beloued Apoſtle, to write an Epiſtle vnto an <hi>Elect Lady?</hi> And are there not whole books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dedicated to their names, as this of <hi>Ruth,</hi> and the other of <hi>Eſter,</hi> for an eternall remembrance of them?</p>
            <p>I hope (Right Honourable Lady) therefore, that I may bee bold to preſent your Honour with this my <hi>Commentary vpon Ruth,</hi> which you may challenge of right before all others, for your bountifull and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall contribution towards my maintenance in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of Cambridge, by the which I am now that I am; and for which, as alſo for your Honours euer-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing fauours to mee and mine, I remaine euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly a debtor.</p>
            <p>Accept therefore, I humbly beſeech your Honour, this my beſt teſtimonie of all dutifull ſeruices, and of the acknowledgement of my moſt thankfull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the ſame. And my hearty and daily prayer is, that the Lord would bleſſe your Honor, that as both

The titles of the Bookes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Writ, ſhew either the principall matter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as <hi>Geneſis, Exodus, Leuiticus, Numbers, Pſalmes, Prouerbs,</hi> and many other, or who were the Pen-men, as the Bookes of <hi>Samuel, Eſdras,</hi> or what perſon chiefely is there ſpoken of, as <hi>Iob, Eſter, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> here; who though but a woman, and of that weake ſexe, yet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1830:6"/> being truly religious, ſee how the Lord doth her honour to all poſterities: a ſingular incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto vertue and godlineſſe.</p>
            <p>Who penned this, is not certaine: but certaine it is by the Genealogie, Chap. 4. 18, 22. that the Scribe liued in <hi>Dauids</hi> time, and therefore is it held to be <hi>Samuels</hi> by ſome.

The Scribes name is concealed, the Lords pleaſure was not to haue it mentioned, and therefore after hidden things wee will not make further enquirie, eſpecially in a matter of no more moment.</p>
            <p>The booke is diuided into foure Chapters, being, as it were, the parts of the booke: the firſt ſheweth <hi>Ruths</hi> iournying to Iudah, with the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions thereto, and cauſes thereof: the ſecond, her entertainement, and her carriage and paines there: the third, her contract with <hi>Boaz,</hi> a Noble man of Bethlehem, and how it was procured: and the fourth, her ſolemne marriage, with the ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iſſue thereof.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His chapter telleth vs how <hi>Ruth</hi> came to Bethlehem, who being marryed to a mans ſonne of Iudah, in her owne countrey, for the grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in her heart, and the loue ſhee bare to her mother in law, after the death of her husband and father in law, forſooke her people, countrey, and idolatrie, and went into the Land of Iudah, to dwell with Gods people, and came thither with her mother in law, in the beginning of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley harueſt.</p>

                     <hi>Verſe 1.</hi> And it came to paſſe in the dayes when the Iudges ruled, that there was a famine in the Land, and a certaine man of Bethlehem Iudah went to ſoiourne in the Countrey of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two ſonnes.</head>
                  <p>THis verſe is an entrance into the Story, and is the deſcription of a iourney: and therein note, when, vpon what occaſion, from whence, whither, and who tooke it in hand, and with what company he finiſhed it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And it came to paſſe.</hi>] To wit, by the hand and prouidence of God. Thus he beginneth this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, to note a <hi>ſpeciall hand of God in all this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, beyond mans purpoſe and thought,</hi> in bringing a famine, and in <hi>Elimelechs</hi> going into Moab, to take a wife for his ſonne, euen this <hi>Ruth,</hi> to make
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1830:7"/> her a mother in Iſrael: and therefore are we dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to marke the prouidence of God in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Storie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the dayes when the Iudges ruled.</hi>] This telleth vs, when this happened; In hiſtoricall narrations the time with other circumſtances are ſet downe, for more credit to the Story, Iudg. 1. 1. 2. Sam. 1. 1. 1. King. 1. 1. As in humane Stories this is obſerued, ſo here in Diuine. Thus God in mercy deſcendeth to vs, for the better confirmation of our weake faith, for which hee is to be praiſed. We may note out of theſe words:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>That the Iſraelites were euer vnder gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> vnder <hi>Moſes, Ioſhua,</hi> the Iudges, and then Kings: this was needefull, to preuent diſorder and confuſion of State, when men are not vnder rule and gouernement: for then will euery one doe what he liſteth, Iudg. 18. and 20. Which condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Anarchie and all looſe liberty, deſtruction to Church and Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>That their gouernement was firſt by Iudges,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioſephus in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. lib. 4. cap. 8. de Ariſtocratia.</note> that they might ſee the Lords extraordinarie hand in this gouerning of them, 1. Sam. 8. 6, 7. and that they might not bee as other Nations, 1. Sam. 8. 5. nor in bondage, 1. Sam. 8. 9, 18. Theſe Iudges were raiſed vp for the moſt part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, to ſhew more fully the Lords care of his people, they were worthy and excellent men, not all of the ſame Tribe and Family, but ſometime of one, then of another: they ruled not by tyranny, or the aduice of man, but by the counſell and guidance of God; They loaded
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1830:7"/> not the people with heauie burthens to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine great State: In their daies, they ſought the welfare of the people, the glory of God, not their owne wills and pleaſures to rule after their owne luſts. They would not raigne themſelues, but the<note place="margin">Iudg. 8. 23.</note> Lord, as <hi>Gideon</hi> ſaid, ſhould raigne ouer the people. Thus happily did the Lord prouide for his people, till they did ſhake off his yoake, and brought themſelues into bondage: for ſo it falleth out, if men like not of Gods choyce, he leaueth them to their owne, of which they ſhall bee ſure to repent.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>That ſuch as be ſet ouer a people, are to rule them, but yet in iudgement:</hi> for the Hebrew word tranſlated <hi>Ruled,</hi> is <hi>Iudged,</hi> and Rulers were to iudge, 1. Sam. 7. 15. And this muſt they doe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen labour wiſely to rule and gouerne in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They are to rule, to maintaine their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which elſe will lie, through contempt, in the duſt, and they muſt doe it in iudgement, that equitie may be vpheld, and nothing be done raſhly, partially, and to the hurt of innocencie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That there was a famine.</hi>] This might happen many waies by the incurſion of Forraine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by ciuill warres among themſelues, or by reſtraint of ſeaſonable ſhowres from heauen: howſoeuer it came, ſinne was the cauſe thereof: for wee may reade in the time of theſe Iudges, howſoeuer they themſelues did valiantly, and right worthily in Iſrael, yet the people would run into many miſchiefes, ſo as we by ſearching, may find theſe euils among them: A toleration
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1830:8"/> of Idolaters, and publike Monuments of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, <hi>Iud.</hi> 1. 21, 27, 29, 30. and 3. 5. and 2. 2. contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Gods expreſſe Commandement by the hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi> They fell themſelues vnto idolatry, Ch. 2. 11, 12, 13, 17. and 8. 27. for but tolerate it in others firſt, then we like it at length in our ſelues, as many examples witneſſe. They would defend it, and that with bloodſhed, Chap. 6. 30. for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters are of a murtherous diſpoſition, as their <hi>god-Deuill</hi> is, whome they worſhip, as <hi>Manaſſes, Ioaſh, Iehoram,</hi> and other Kings doe manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and as wee haue experimentally found at the hands of Papiſts. See heere a toleration firſt, then an approbation, then an open defence of an idolatrous worſhip; and when this is once on foote, what darkeneſſe doth not ouerſpread? They did what themſelues liſted, Chap. 17. 6. and 18. 1. and 21. 25. They fell to adultery, and filthy Sodomitry, Chap. 19. Thus they forgot the Lords mercies, and therefore he ſeuerely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, as the ſtory of the Iudges ſhew, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them into the hands of their enemies, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly to oppreſſe them; and heere by famine to plague them. From whence we may obſerue:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>That ſins, eſpecially theſe aforenamed, deſerue the Iudgements of God,</hi> Deut. 28. 1. King. 8. 35, 36, 37. becauſe ſinnes prouoke and incenſe the wrathfull indignation of the Lord againſt men, as appeareth by his terrible threatnings, Pſ. 11. 6. Rom. 2. and his inflicted puniſhments vpon euill doers, of which there want not examples in the Scripture: as the old world, Sodom, Iſraelites
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1830:8"/> in Wilderneſſe, in Canaan; and therefore to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape plagues, let vs take heede of ſinne, Ezech. 18. 31. Reu. 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>That famine and dearth is a puniſhment for ſinne, and that a great plague,</hi> Ezech. 5. 16. Deut. 28. 23, 24. Leuit. 26. 19, 20. Amos 4. Therefore to auoide it, either preuent ſinne, that it bee not committed, or if we be ouertaken, repent of ſinne, and that ſincerely, and ſpeedily. And when this hand of God commeth vpon vs, let vs ſearch our waies, and let vs humble our ſelues, 2. Chro. 7. 14. that the Lord may heale our Land: for it is a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iudgement, 1. Sam. 24. 14. and without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, 2. King. 6. 10, 29. Ezech. 4. 10. This famine men do know: yet there is another Famine, which few know, or if they know it, they feare it not, the famine of the Word, Amos 8. 11. which the Lord threatneth by that Prophet, as a greater plague, than th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> famine of bread and water, the foode for the body: and yet alas, who feareth it? who are touched with the terrour of this plague?</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>We may hereby ſee how God made his word good vpon them, and that he dallyeth not with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in denouncing iudgements against them:</hi> for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had told them, Deut. 28. that God would thus afflict them, if they would bee rebellious againſt hm: and heere the ſtory telleth vs, that in the daies of the Iudges, this plague of famine came vpon them. This <hi>Ezechiel</hi> verifieth in Chap. 6. 10. and the puniſhments inflicted, as the Lord denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them, ſhewe the truth hereof, that the Lord ſpeaketh ſeriouſly; hee doth not ieſt with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1830:9"/> ſinners; he will certainely make good vpon them what he threatneth, as may be ſeene vpon <hi>Iezabel, Ely's</hi> ſons, and vpon his houſe, vpon <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>roboam, Ioa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, Zedechiah,</hi> and on Ieruſalem. For the Lord is the God that hateth iniquity, and is iuſt in his Word, euen the God of Truth, as well in threats, as in promiſes: And therefore let vs feare the Lyons roaring, and not be like him that bleſſeth himſelfe, and dreadeth not the curſe, Deu. 29. 18. but preſumeth of mercy, as if God were not alſo iuſt to puniſh offenders. But ſuch muſt know, they deceiue themſelues, they harden their own harts, they abuſe Gods mercy, which is to worke feare, Pſal. 130. 4. Ier. 33. 9. and obedience, Rom. 12. 1. They ſpoyle God of his Iuſtice and Truth in his threats, &amp; incenſe the Lords wrath to plague them in a high degree, as he threatneth in Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomie 29. 19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Land.</hi>] In the Land of Canaan, the Kingdome of Iſrael, where God had placed them, planted them, and promiſed to them his bleſſings plentifully: yet ſee now, for their ſinnes, in a Land once flowing with Milke and Honey, Ezech. 20. 6. they finde ſcarcity. Hence note:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>That people depriue themſelues, by their ſinnes, of that which God had giuen, and they enioyed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe.</hi> For ſinne will depriue An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of heauen, <hi>Adam</hi> of Paradiſe, <hi>Cain</hi> of his honour, <hi>Ruben</hi> of his birth-right, thouſands of the Land of Canaan, though they came out of Egypt: Ieruſalem of her Kings, her Temple, Peace and proſperity; men of their honours, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1830:9"/> 
                     <hi>Ieroboam, Haman;</hi> of their libertie, as <hi>Manaſſes;</hi> of health, as <hi>Vzziah;</hi> of their liues, as <hi>Corah</hi> with his company. Let vs then blame our ſelues for our miſeries, and not the Lord for puniſhing vs, as wee deſerue. And if we would hold the bleſſings which wee doe inioy, beware of ſinne, which will robbe vs of all we haue.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>That a fruitfull Land is made barraine for the ſinnes of the inhabitants thereof,</hi> Pſal. 107. Leu. 26. 19, 20. And theſe ſins in particular procure this plague; The abuſe of Gods mercies, Luk. 15. 14. Idolatrie, 1. King. 17. 1. 2. King. 4. 36. The murthering of innocents, 2. Sam. 21. 1. and the oppreſſion of the poore, Amos 4. 1, 6. Know then how to preuent hereby ſcarcity: and in the time of want, turne from ſinne by repentance, and blame not the heauens, or earth: murmure not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vnſeaſonable weather, but be diſpleaſed with our ſinfull ſelues.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Iudgement begins at the houſe of the Lord,</hi> 1. Pet. 4. Ezech. 9. hee will ſhew his hatred of ſinne vpon the land of the liuing: for he cannot ſuffer euill in his people; if a <hi>Moſes,</hi> an <hi>Aaron,</hi> a <hi>Dauid,</hi> a <hi>Ioſias</hi> ſinne, they ſhall feele the ſmart of it. Now therefore if iudgement begin at Gods Houſe, what ſhall become of Gods enemies? If the Church feele wrath, what may the Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries expect?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A certaine man of Bethlehem Iudah.</hi>] Iudah the Royall Tribe: And this is added for diſtinction, becauſe there was another Bethlehem in Zebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Ioſh. 19. 15. This Bethlehem was called
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1830:10"/> Ephrata, Gen. 35. 13. ſixe miles from Ieruſalem, as ſome ſay: here <hi>Iacob</hi> fed his ſheepe, Gen. 31. heere <hi>Rachel</hi> died, <hi>Dauid</hi> was borne, and Ieſus Chriſt our Lord; It had the name from Plenty, and ſignifieth the <hi>Houſe of bread;</hi> So as we ſee, the noble Tribe of Iudah, and this honourable place of Bethlehem felt this ſcourge of God. <hi>No place is exempt from the puniſhment, where ſinne is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to reigne:</hi> It bringeth famine vpon Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem Iudah, and on the Land of Iſrael, it bringeth the ſword and famine into Ieruſalem. There is then no place to keepe vs free from feeling the puniſhment, if ſinne be not remoued: chaſe out this, and call home againe the Lords bleſſings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Went to ſoiourne.</hi>] As a ſtranger in another Countrey from his owne home. We here ſee, how <hi>God can remoue by one meanes or another, men out of ther homes and harbour. Dauid,</hi> through iuſt feare of <hi>Abſalom</hi> out of Ieruſalem; <hi>Manaſſes</hi> by force out of his Kingdome into priſon: other by vnthriftineſſe caſt out themſelues: ſome volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily leaue their habitation and place of abode, and returne not againe. All which came about by the hand of God, who hath all things at his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, that no man may thinke himſelfe ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſettled; eſpecially if he be a <hi>Shebnah,</hi> the Lord<note place="margin">Eſay. 22. 15, 16, 17.</note> will driue ſuch out, Amos 4. 2, 3. Note againe, how <hi>feare of corporall wants will make men leaue their home, their natiue ſoyle, their friends and kindred, to goe into a ſtrange countrey.</hi> So forcible is nature for preſeruation of bodily life, which man ſo much eſteemeth and loueth. This ſhould then
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1830:10"/> make men care to keepe the bleſſings prouident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and frugally, alſo to auoide the occaſions and meanes of waſtfull miſspending, ſeeing ſeare of want will thus work. And if the loue of corporall life be ſo forcible, how much more the loue of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, for which we ſhould be willing to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all? But alas, the leaſt worldly gaine, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pleaſure baniſheth this loue out of many mens hearts, who rather follow here <hi>Elimelech,</hi> to leaue the people of God, to goe into Moab for the world, than <hi>Abraham,</hi> to forſake his Countrie, at the comandement of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Country of Moab.</hi>] This Moab was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by thoſe which came of <hi>Lots</hi> eldeſt ſonne<note place="margin">Gen. 19. 37. Num. 22. 6.</note> inceſtuouſly begotten; of this was <hi>Balak</hi> King, who hyred <hi>Balaam</hi> to curſe Iſrael, who commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fornication with the Daughters thereof, to the deſtruction of thouſands; ouer this Land reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Eglon,</hi> who ſmote Iſrael, and poſſeſſed ſome<note place="margin">Iudg. 3. 12. 13, 14,</note> part of the Land, and kept them in bondage eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres; ſome think that <hi>Elimelech</hi> iournied to Moab in his dayes: howſoeuer, by this wee may learne, that <hi>wicked Idolaters may haue ſometime plenty, when the people of God are in want.</hi> Here Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab had plenty, when Iſrael was vnder a famine. Of the proſperity of the wicked, read Pſal. 73. 4. &amp; 17. 14. &amp; 37. 15. Iob 21. 7, 13. and of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the godly, Heb. 11. 37. And this commeth to paſſe, becauſe the wicked are at home here; here their heauen and time of reioycing: but the godly are not here at home, the Lord looketh for their comming to him, and therefore prepareth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1830:11"/> them by croſſes, he loueth them, and therefore doth he correct them, that they might not be damned. Hence then it followeth, that we are not to iudge mens ſpirituall eſtates by outward proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity or aduerſitie; for the wicked haue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt portion of the things of this life: See it in the parable of the Rich man and <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Why doe men then bleſſe themſelues for their wealth and honour, and deſpiſe their poore brethren, in a farre better eſtate before God than they?</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Whether did</hi> Elimelech <hi>well to goe from Bethlehem, into ſuch an idolatrous country?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may ſeeme not, becauſe he went of diſtruſt, rather than of preſent want, verſe 21. and for that he left the place of Gods true worſhip, and where the Lord promiſed his bleſſing, Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an alſo being a type of the Kingdome of heauen, to goe among the wicked Idolaters, whom the Lord by name alſo had forbidden to be receiued vnto his people, Deut. 23. 3. Neh. 13. 1. Further, hereby he could not but endanger his family, to be defiled by idolatrie, if the Lord had not beene more mercifull. And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this: We ſee how the Lords taking both him and his ſonnes away, may ſomewhat perſwade, that he did not wel, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord ſuffered him not to returne home againe. True it is, that <hi>Dauid</hi> went out of Iudah, vnto Idolaters, for feare of <hi>Saul,</hi> but it was againſt his will, and with much ſorrow of heart. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> he traueled into Egypt, but it was at Gods bidding: and the Shunamite might by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets warrant goe into ſome place out of Iſrael,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1830:11"/> to preuent the miſery of famine, 2. Kings 8. 1, 2. But what is this to ſuch as haue no ſuch warrant, but ſuch mouing cauſes, as here?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hee, and his wife, and his two ſonnes.</hi>] This is praiſe-worthy in him: For <hi>an honeſt man careth for his wife and children, as well as for himſelfe. Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> tooke his wife with him into Egypt, Gen. 12. 18. <hi>Iacob</hi> all his with him, Gen. 42. for the wife is as himſelfe, Gen. 2. and ſo to be loued, Eph. 5. and the children are bone of his bone. Reaſon and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tyed <hi>Elimelech</hi> to this: an example of a louing husband and of a naturall parent to be imitated; and which condemneth thoſe which runne away from wiſe and children, and are worſe than Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, 1. Tim. 5. 8. yea than the bruit beaſts. This ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> led them, they followed him: ſo wines and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are to be companions with their husbands and parents in aduerſitie. <hi>Sarah</hi> will follow <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Rachel</hi> and <hi>Lea Iacob</hi> from their country and fathers houſe; and <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Ieſus will follow <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> for the husband is the head, and the bond of law bindeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereto: which checketh the contrarie; if husbands and parents doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be followed &amp; obeyed in things lawfull. If <hi>Elimelech,</hi> as it may ſeeme, did not well to goe, it may be queſtioned whether theſe did well to follow him? He might doe amiſſe, &amp; not they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſo long as he led them not to doe euill, and to commit idolatrie, but for ſuſtentation of life, &amp; in that country where they were not outwardly compelled to idolatrie, but might ſerue God, as they had learned at home.

By which wee ſee how carefull the holy Ghoſt is to make cleare the Hiſtory, and to free it from ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpeech that the truth might better appeare, and not be miſtaken. <hi>The Penmen of this and other diuine Hiſtories are Faithfull Hiſtorians:</hi> and ſuch ſhould others be, and not full of fables, falſhood and deceit, written through feare, or fauour, or ill will.</p>

It may further ſeeme by the courſe of this Story, that theſe Bethlehemites were not onely ſuffred to dwell among the Moabites, but alſo that they were kindly vſed, in that they would be content to marry with them, which is a commendation to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1830:15"/> them, that would thus welcome ſuch, as came among them for ſuccour. <hi>It is a matter praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be harberſome to ſtrangers;</hi> for this were the Barbarians commended, Act. 28. 2, 7, 10. who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Apoſtle and the reſt into their houſes, made them fires becauſe of the cold and raine in Winter, courteouſly lodged them, and when they departed, being ſuch as had ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, and were thereby in want, thoſe Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians helped them with neceſſaries.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And</hi> Elimelech <hi>dyed.</hi>] His age is not reckoned, he could not bee very old, if wee may gaſſe his yeeres by his ſonnes marrying ſo young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men after his death, yet he dyeth, yea and there alſo, wither he went for food to preſerue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> life: He went firſt from Iſrael, the Land of the liuing, and led them thence, and ſo he now goeth out of the world before them; from whence note:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>That death is the end of all, and it ſpareth none,</hi> Ioſh. 23. 14. Iob 21. 33. Eccleſ. 7. 2. and 6. 6. 1. Cor. 15. 51. Heb. 9. 27. for all haue ſinned, Rom. 5. and death is the reward of ſinne, Rom. 6. And therefore let all prepare to die.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>That a full ſupplie of bodily wants cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent death:</hi> The man muſt die in Moab, where was food enough: the rich Glutton muſt die alſo, and the Rich man with his barne full: for the ſentence of death is irreuocable, and mans life dependeth not vpon the outward meanes of life, for then the rich and mighty would neuer die.</p>
                  <p>Let not men in their abundance thinke to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape death: let them therefore not ſet their hearts on their wealth, for they muſt leaue it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Naomies husband.</hi>] It is not ſaid her husband, which might well haue beene ſpoken, by way of relation to her, without her name, becauſe ſhee was named before, and no other woman; but this woman was a very vertuous woman, and this was a great croſſe to her, and therefore, both to expreſſe her excellency, and her begun miſery, it is ſaid, <hi>Naomies husband</hi> dyed, the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of ſo rare a wife died. Note hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>That it is a grace for ſome, to be called the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of ſome women;</hi> their name is a grace to them, if they be vertuous: for ſuch a one is a crowne to her husband, Pro. 12. 4. Now, a crowne is high glory to a man: and <hi>her husband</hi> is knowne in the gates, Pro. 31. 23. Such wiues are to bee made much of, as rare Birdes; for too many may ſit downe with ſhame, and bluſh to bee named the husbands of ſome wiues: Fooliſh, though faire: faire, but perhaps filthy: rich, but withal retchleſſe: wiues, but without gouernement, husbands na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the head, but they muſt bee maſters: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time painefull, but Peacok-like proud; often more mad, or fullen ſad, than merrie; if merrie, it keepes not in with modeſty; if ſhe ſpeake, it is lowd, often heard farther, then ſeene, and yet ofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1830:17"/> ſeene by a quiet husband, then well liked of. In a word, a wicked fooliſh woman, is ſhame to his perſon, and rottenneſſe to his bones, Pro. 12. 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>That grace in one, preuents not death in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Naomies</hi> husband muſt die, ſo <hi>Abrahams</hi> wife alſo: <hi>Iacob</hi> muſt bid his <hi>Rachel</hi> adieu, and<note place="margin">Ezech. 24. 16.</note>

                  <p n="3">III. <hi>That it is a great croſſe for a woman to loſe a good husband.</hi> This is implied, as I ſaid, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming her by name; for in him the wife loſeth her head, her guide, her ſtay, and comfort, if hee be a vertuous man, and a good husband. I neede not intreat good and louing wiues to mourne for ſuch; ſure enough they haue cauſe: and wiues cannot but mourne, except they conceit a new comfort very quickly, as ſome doe, for feare the old griefe ſhould lye too long at the heart for him that is dead, and cannot be recalled; ſo with them, the liuing is better to be liked of, than the dead: for they know their husbands would, perhaps, haue ſo dealt with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhee was left and her two ſonnes.</hi>] Death ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1830:18"/> onely vpon <hi>Elimelech,</hi> and left <hi>Naomi,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo her ſonnes, that ſhe might not be vtterly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe in a ſtrange countrey. From this may we note theſe two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>That albeit death is due to all</hi> (in as much as all haue ſinned) <hi>yet it ſeazeth not vpon all at once;</hi> but one dyeth now, and another hereafter, as we ſee in all ages, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not to paſſe for any good in one, more than in another; but God will haue mankind vpon earth till the laſt day; hee forbeareth ſome, and repriueth them for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment; for the lengthning of life, is for our further repentance, if wee bee the Lords, or for the greater condemnation of ſuch, as ſhall periſh. For this mercy God is to bee praiſed, for we deſerue death, and it might ſeaze vpon euery one at once, and take vs away, becauſe wee are borne in ſinne, brought vp therein, and none ſo free euer, but in his higheſt pitch of well-doing, he may be tainted of ſinne, 1. Ioh. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>That the Lord in afflicting his children, ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth the ſame with ſome comforts:</hi> he wholly lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not them without ſome taſte of his mercy and goodneſſe, as we may ſee in his dealing with <hi>Naomi:</hi> he tooke away her husband, and left two ſonnes; and after tooke them away, but gaue her an excellent daughter in Law. <hi>Eliſha</hi> had an<note place="margin">2.

It was a bitter affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to be ſold of his brethren, but it was ſweetened with <hi>Potiphars</hi> fauour; This at length impriſoned him vniuſty, but the Lord
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1830:16"/> gaue him fauour in the eyes of the Keeper of the Priſon, to ſugar this bitter pill with. And this the Lord doth in mercy, that his children might not be ouerwhelmed with griefe, and ſwallowed vp of ſorrow: therefore by one meanes he caſts them downe, but by another ſuſtaineth them. Let not therefore men, which feare God, bee ouer-ſad when afflictions come; God will lay no more then they can beare: he layeth on them a burthen, but he putteth vnder his hand. If wee looke vpon the affliction, let vs alſo conſider, what cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort wee haue; marke when, for what, how long or ſhort, what it is allayed with, that we bee not wholy caſt downe.</p>

                  <p>THis ſheweth what courſe the ſonnes tooke after their fathers death, they returned not home: this croſſe brought them not to thinke of leauing that idolatrous Countrey, but they ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelues to marry there; ſo as this verſe telleth vs of two things; the firſt is, of a marriage, and herein who they were, the men, <hi>Elimelechs</hi> ſonnes, the women, who are ſet out by their Countrey, then by their names: the ſecond is, of their abode in Moab, and time how long.</p>
                  <p>Note (before I come to the words) that <hi>euery croſſe bringeth not men home againe:</hi> their fathers

And this commeth for want of waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true cauſe of afflictions, when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, or deſire to pleaſe other, or the loue of this world, or ſome ſuch corruption of our heart. To bewaile this our peruerſe nature not eaſily reformed, a great affliction muſt worke on <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes,</hi> great diſtreſſe muſt preſſe the prodigall ſonne, before they will come to themſelues, and turne to the Lord, yea ſome are worſe for afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as may be ſeene in <hi>Achaz,</hi> 2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And they tooke them.</hi>] This may ſeeme an act of their owne, as that of <hi>Lamech,</hi> Geneſis 4. 19. and that of the ſonnes of God, 6. 2. and not their mothers deed, as is ſaid of <hi>Hagar,</hi> Gene. 21. 21. If they did this with her conſent, it was as <hi>godly children ſhould doe, to marry with conſent of parents:</hi> For parents haue authoritie in this caſe, 1.

Let children therefore herein take aduice of their parents; they ſhall thriue the better: if they doe

                  <p>
                     <hi>Wiues.</hi>] So women be called, when they be marryed vnto men, or betrothed. It is as if it had beene ſaid, They tooke yong women for wiues to liue in Gods ordinance, and not for wantons, to liue in vncleanneſſe. Though they were not in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, yet they let not looſe the vnbrideled luſt of nature, but vſed marriage the ordinance of God. So men are to take women as wiues, to liue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Gods holy ordinance; as the godly haue euer made conſcience to doe; and not to liue as bruite beaſts, to defile themſelues; as <hi>Hamor</hi> did <hi>Dinah,</hi> and <hi>Zimri</hi> did <hi>Cozbi,</hi> in the ſinne of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

And this commeth through mens obſtinacie in ſinne, and for that ſuch things are not reformed, as God commandeth, or for that ſome euils are not puniſhed, as they ought to bee; as for innocent blood-ſhed, 1. Sam. 21. 1. for open idolatrie, and murthering of the Saints, as in <hi>Achabs</hi> dayes. We are in ſuch continuing iudgements, to looke to our waies, and bewaile our ſinnes: alſo ſeeing thus

                     <hi>And the woman was left of her two ſons, &amp; her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi>] This is added, to aggrauate the affliction of <hi>Naomi;</hi> and doth teach, that <hi>neither few nor light afflictions ſometime befall the godly.

What ſhall I ſpeake of <hi>Iobs</hi> trialls, <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remies</hi> troubles, and <hi>Pauls</hi> perſecutions? Yet God thus ſuffers his to be tried, to make them know themſelues, to ſhew them their graces, and their imperfections, which in affliction they will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; to weane them from the world, to the loue of a better life, to whip them from their ſinnes, and to make our vile natures tame, to ſubmit to his yoke. Let vs looke therefore for them, let vs be contented and patient vnder them, and conſider the troubles of others of old, and in the primitiue Church, and of later times.

It is a fault to murmure at him, it is an error to thinke our eſtate to be euill before God, becauſe of ſundry and great croſſes; for many are the afflictions of the righteous: he ſaith not, of the wicked, yet then righteous, when they be afflicted: this is comfort againſt deſpaire.</p>

                     <hi>Verſe 7.</hi> Wherefore ſhee went forth out of the place where ſhee was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on their way to returne vnto the Land of Iudah.</head>
                  <p>IN the former verſe, was <hi>Naomi</hi> her preparation for her iourney; here is her ſetting forward: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from whence, with whom, and whither.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherefore.</hi>] That is, becauſe ſhe heard of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in her countrey: which giueth vs this to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, which before I noted, that <hi>the Churches welfare procureth friends, and draweth her old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance to her:</hi> for proſperity is of an attractiue vertue, and men are affected with it; this will make <hi>Abimelech</hi> to ſeeke to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 26. 26. and <hi>Iobs</hi> friends gather vnto him, Iob. 42. 11. This ſhould make vs ſeeke the Churches proſperity;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1830:25"/> yea and make men frugall to preſerue their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates: for proſperity gets friends (though not a few counterfeit:) and aduerſity maketh men to bee forſaken; and yet many which might liue well, bring themſelues by prodigality and lewd courſes vnto miſery: vnworthy they bee of pitty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Shee departed out of the place where ſhee was.</hi>] In what particular place of Moab ſhee was in, is not named, though here to bee vnderſtood by the name <hi>place.</hi> There was food here, as well as in Iudah, yet ſhee would not ſtay though ſhee was an old woman, hauing poore and weake atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, the iourney ſomewhat long for her, her eſtate waſted, and therefore was ſhee to returne in a baſe eſtate, which other perhaps might caſt in her teeth for leauing Iudah, and going into that idolatrous Moab; but all theſe things did not withhold her from her godly purpoſe. And two reaſons may be giuen for this; the loue of her owne Countrey, and her piety, eſteeming highly of the means of ſaluation. Whence may be noted:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>there is a loue naturally in euery one to their owne Countrey;</hi> See it in <hi>Iethro,</hi> Exo. 18. 27. Num. 10. 29, 30. and <hi>Barzillai,</hi> 2. Sam. 19. 27. <hi>Iacob</hi> would returne into Canaan out of Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia where he had gotten great riches. And this loue vnto their Countrey, made men to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture their liues in defence thereof, 2. Sam. 10. 12. Therefore ſuch are vnnaturall, who will ſeeke the deſtruction thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That <hi>corporall meanes cannot keepe the truely
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1830:25"/> religious from the place where God is worſhipped, if they may enioy the meanes of life in a poore meaſure. Naomi</hi> would not ſtay in Moab, though ſhee in Iudah had nothing to maintaine her, but her hands, and that <hi>Ruth</hi> muſt gleane for bread, when they came thither. What a change <hi>Moſes</hi> made, wee all doe know: a cruſt of bread for the body is better with the food of the ſoule, than all carnall abundance without it. And therefore if the choyce of our dwelling be, either where bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily plenty is, whithout the Word, or a poore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for the body, and plentifull inſtructions for the ſoules ſafety, let vs chuſe this, rather then the other. Seeke, ſaith our Sauiour, for the food<note place="margin">Iohn 5.</note> which endureth vnto eternall life, which periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And her two daughters in law with her.</hi>] This their accompanying of her, argueth <hi>Naomi</hi> her ſingular good carriage towards them, while her ſonnes liued: for if ſhee had beene proud, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and vnkind, as ſome mothers in law haue beene, they would haue deſpiſed her, and ſhaken her off; but we ſee: firſt, how <hi>good carriage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth loue:</hi> and ſecondly, how <hi>true loue ſheweth it ſelfe in the aduerſity of a friend,</hi> Pro. 17. 17. for theſe 2. forſake not poore &amp; old <hi>Naomi</hi> in this her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible eſtate. Thus <hi>Ionathan</hi> ſhewed his loue in <hi>Dauids</hi> trouble, and <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, when they ſate downe by him; for true loue is not tyed to outward reſpects: ſuch loue is falſe and hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted; the loue of theſe times. We muſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate God in loue, to loue euer, and chiefely in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1830:26"/> aduerſity; for either loue them, or not at all. Be not as the Shadow which ſheweth it ſelfe only in ſunne-ſhine; nor as the Swallow which chatters, and ſings ouer thy chimney in warme Summer, but cannot be ſeene in Winter. Friends onely in appearance, ſhape their loue like to the Deuill, who onely maketh a ſhew of loue to man, and is euer ſiniſter in the intendement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they went on their way to returne to Iudah.</hi>] It ſeemeth by this, that the two women came out to returne with <hi>Naomi,</hi> who onely is properly ſaid to returne, becauſe ſhe came out of Iudah, and they had a purpoſe to goe thorow with her to the end, and to leaue their own natiue ſoile, their parents and friends, which was a great degree of loue, but yet we may reade that <hi>Orpha</hi> afterwards gaue ouer. <hi>To begin well, and to make an onſet to goodneſſe, is eaſie to many, but to go on to the end, is of ſpeciall grace. Cain</hi> began and made an onſet to godlineſſe, ſo did <hi>Ioaſh</hi> King of Iudah. <hi>Iehu</hi> did valiantly for a while. <hi>Iudas</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee approued by his fellowes, and to liue without ſuſpicion for a time. The ſame may bee ſaid of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> of <hi>Demas, Hymeneus, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> with many moe; but their calling was not effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall: called they were, but not elected: their hearts were full of hypocriſie, which wil at length breake out. Therefore let none thinke well of themſelues for faire beginnings, becauſe they that continue to the end, ſhall onely be ſaued.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And</hi> Naomi <hi>ſaid vnto her two daughters in law.</hi>] To this place, there is no mention of any ſpeech of <hi>Naomi,</hi> but onely what ſhee did: Firſt, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing her huſband into Moab, verſe. 1, 2. and then, of his leauing that Countrey to returne into Iudah, verſe. 6, 7. Hitherto her Story is of her walking, and not of her words and talking: it ſeemeth her tongue did not hang looſe, to be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery touch tolling, as ſome womens be. And this her ſilence commendeth her vertue therein, and alſo giueth vs to know, that ſhe did not ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite her daughters to go with her, but that they voluntarily vndertooke the iourney: for if ſhee had requeſted them, their loue had not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, neither could ſhe haue tried them, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating them to returne backe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Goe and returne.</hi>] How farre on the way they were come, is not noted; but on the way they were, before ſhe ſpake thus to them; which ſhe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1830:27"/> did not, as careleſſe of their ſoules, or of any doubt, whether God would prouide for them, who would forſake their country, and become proſelytes; but two reaſons may be alledged why ſhee exhorteth them to returne home againe. Firſt was her loue to them, for their kindneſſes formerly to her and hers, as appeareth by her prayer, and therefore ſhee might now ſeeme to be loth to trouble them, though their company in the way might haue beene comfortable, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſhee had knowne certainely how to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced their loue. Taking this for one, we learne, that <hi>a true Louer is loth to diſaduantage a friend or friends for priuate reſpects to himſelfe:</hi> for true loue ſeeketh alſo the good of a friend belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and a found-harted friend will follow the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles aduice, 1. Cor. 10. 24. not ſeeke his owne, but his friends well-fare. But this alas is contrary to our times, when now men are all for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; which ſelfe-loue is contrarie to Chriſts commandement, to loue our neighbour as our ſelues; it is againſt the communion &amp; fellowſhip of Chriſtians as members one of another; it is contrary to the end of our labour in our callings, 2. Cor. 12. 14. Eph. 4. 28. which is, to doe good to others; contrary to that care which God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, for the preſeruation of other mens eſtate, Deut. 22. 2, 4. Exod. 23. 4, 5. contrary to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> practice, Gene. 23. 9. whoſe children we muſt be, and whoſe workes we muſt doe. This ſelfe-loue is the originall of all bribery, extortion, vſury, deceit, fraud, oppreſſion, and vniuſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1830:27"/> among men; this maketh men enuious, that they cannot reioyce in other mens welfare, and this maketh men without compaſſion in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans miſery, if they themſelues liue at eaſe: this roote of bitterneſſe muſt be rooted out. The ſecond reaſon was her want of meanes, to giue them comfort in the world, to prouide for them neceſſaries, or conuenient matches, as her words imply in verſes 12, 13: ſhee knew them to haue friends &amp; parents in Moab, but none in Iudah, and therefore ſhee was loth to make them worſe, and to carry them to an vnknowne place, except ſhee could better haue prouided for them with ſome certainty. True loue will not make worſe, where it cannot make better. But here it may be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Whether Naomi did well, to perſwade them to returne?</hi> I anſwer, If ſhe had done it in careleſneſſe of their ſoules, or in a coldneſſe of religion, ſhee had offended: but it was partly in her loue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their outward eſtate, not knowing how to pleaſure them, if they ſhould take ſuch paines to goe with her, and leaue their owne country, and partly out of her wiſedome to trie them, whether indeed they fully reſolued to goe with her, let fall out, what might fall out. And this was praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy in her, thus to try their ſoundneſſe: for hereby ſhee found one rotten at the core, and the other moſt ſound. And thus ſhould wee alſo doe in theſe deceitfull dayes, trie before we truſt ſuch as offer themſelues to come among the godly, as alſo did our Sauiour, Luke 9. 57, 58. leſt when they haſtily intertaine Religion, they
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1830:28"/> as ſuddainely fall backe to the reproach of the Goſpell, and blemiſh of ſuch as admitted them without tryall. If any aske why ſhee perſwaded them not to ſtay at home whilſt they were there, but to let them goe on the way, and then to will them to returne backe? I anſwer, It may be that ſhe tooke their comming forth to be of courteſie to take leaue of her, after ſhe had gone ſomewhat on her iourney; which kindneſſe there was no reaſon to refuſe; but perceiuing that they would goe on, ſhee then fell to make tryall of them, and to vnderſtand what might leade them thereto. And this was better done in the way, than at home, to diſcerne more fully of their reſolution. <hi>In the tryall of others it is then beſt done, when the ſame may moſt appeare; this is wiſedome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Each to her mothers houſe.</hi>] Here is an argument to moue them to returne backe, becauſe they had naturall parents aliue, and ſhee but a mother in law. Shee trieth them with this firſt, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature wrought more then grace. This ſhe knew to be a ſtrong pull-backe, and that nature muſt firſt be ſubdued to follow ſoundly the courſe of godlineſſe. We muſt forſake father and mother for the Goſpell, ſaith Chriſt, yea and deny our ſelues. If thus we can doe, then are we to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the fellowſhip of the faithfull. Theſe words ſhew, they were not naturall ſiſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Naomi</hi> willeth each of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, as hauing either of them a mother. In that <hi>Naomi</hi> thus ſpeaketh, we may further note:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>of either parent, children are drawne with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1830:28"/> moſt affection to their mothers;</hi> becauſe all children haue moſt of their mothers, being conceiued in them, long borne of them, and nurſed by them; alſo, for that mothers are more tender-harted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: and moſt familiar with them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here is their mothers houſe named, though afterward <hi>Ruths</hi> father, Chap. 2. 11. And yet ſome childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee ready enough to deſpiſe their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which is contrary to nature, contrary to the commandement, Exod. 20. Prou. 1. 8. Yea, it is great ingratitude to requite ſo the great paines in conception, in bearing, in nurſing, which a child can neuer recompence: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a curſe is pronounced againſt ſuch children, Deut. 27. 16. Pro. 20. 20. and of this the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> complaineth, Chap. 22. 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That <hi>poore widowes are to be maintained of their able parents, when they be left alone, and cannot maintaine themſelues,</hi> Leuit. 22. 13. 1 Tim. 5. 16. The law of nature, and we ſee, the Law of God leadeth thereto; and <hi>Naomi</hi> knew not whither elſe to ſend them: And whither ſhould children goe, but vnto their parents? If this be ſo, then let pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſee to the well matching of their children, to preuent their pouertie if it may be, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond charge of them. Let children be then ruled of their parents in taking marriage vpon them, ſeeing parents are to be troubled againe with them, if need require. Yea and let husbands haue care, when they haue receiued their wiues porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo to husband the ſame, that they may leaue them to liue after them, and not to be againe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1830:29"/> chargeable to their friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord deale kindly with you.</hi>] Her prayer for them, which was her beſt recompence for their loue, being now poore, and not otherwiſe able to requite them their kindneſſe. Note hence,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>it is a duety to pray for thoſe which doe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vs, or ours good:</hi> So doth <hi>Naomi</hi> here; ſo <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>az</hi> for <hi>Ruth,</hi> Chap. 2. 12. <hi>Dauid</hi> for <hi>Abigails</hi> good counſell, 1. Sam. 25. 33. and <hi>Saul</hi> for <hi>Dauids</hi> ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life, 1. Sam. 24. 19. And this duety let vs performe, as Chriſt in the forme of Prayer hath taught vs, Mat. 6. and not pray onely for our ſelues, as worldlings doe, nor to thinke a fauour done, is requited with I thanke you onely, and that prayer for a bleſſing vpon them is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, eſpecially if they be ſuperiours: and yet we ſee here the practice of ſuperiours to inferiours.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That <hi>at parting, friends are to pray one for another;</hi> as we may ſee the practice of it in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 28. 1, 3. <hi>Laban,</hi> Gen. 31. 55. <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. 43. 14. and in <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 20. 36. It is very Chriſtian like, an argument of loue, and deſire of their owne welfare, which cannot be without Gods prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: put this therefore into practice. True it is, that men now doe it, but it is not with that reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, nor expreſſed with that earneſt deſire, as is meet and befitting in ſuch a caſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That <hi>the godly are perſwaded, that the Lord is a mercifull Rewarder of the dueties of loue, which one doth towards another.</hi> This <hi>Naomi</hi> her prayer to God for them here teacheth: for the godly know, that the Lord hath commanded ſuch dueties; and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1830:29"/> what he commandeth to be done, that will hee reward in the doer. And hereof let vs bee well perſwaded, this wil make vs do our duties cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, though men requite not our paines, becauſe God will. By this reaſon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> encourageth ſeruants to their duties, and to doe what they ought heartily, Col. 3. 24.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That <hi>children ſhould ſo well deſerue of parents, yea though but parents in law, as they may bee moued heartily to pray for them:</hi> as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi</hi> doth in this place. A good carriage is a duty towards all, then much more to parents; and the prayers of parents is a meanes to put a bleſſing vpon their children. But ſome chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are ſo farre from doing their duties to their parents to procure a bleſſing, as they with <hi>Cham</hi> deſerue a curſe; ſuch a one was rebellious <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> bloody <hi>Cain:</hi> ſuch a one was <hi>Ruben Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Leui,</hi> whom the Lord puniſhed.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. That <hi>God will not onely barely reward, but ſo deale with vs, as wee deale with others.</hi> This <hi>Naomi</hi> begges for, this the Lord in mercy will doe, Mat. 7. 2. for our incouragement to well doing, he will reward vs according to our works. This ſhould ſtirre vs vp to doe our duties vnto our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, knowing that as we doe, we ſhall be done vnto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As yee haue dealt with the dead and with mee.</hi>] Here <hi>Naomi</hi> acknowledgeth their louing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and good carriage towards their husbands when they were aliue, and now to her, they being dead: and this maketh her to pray thus for them.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1830:30"/>
                  <p>Note here, firſt, that <hi>daughters of a bad race, may prooue good wiues, and good children in law ſometime:</hi> as theſe daughters of Idolaters did; when God reſtraineth nature, and giueth grace withall. For many times there are tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctable and gentle natures, where Religion is not grafted, theſe by good inſtruction, and Gods bleſſing, may proue excellent wiues. Children therefore are not euer to bee cenſured according to their parents; though it is dangerous to graft in a bad ſtocke: for an hundred to one, but a <hi>Michol</hi> will make a <hi>Dauid</hi> know that ſhee is a <hi>Sauls</hi> daughter. But here, women Chriſtians are taught to ſhew themſelues good wiues and children, or elſe theſe daughters of the Heathen will condemne them, whom <hi>Naomi</hi> commendeth for good wiues. Now, to bee a good wife, a woman muſt know her duty, and be very deſirous to doe it, which ſtands in loue vnfeigned, in feare to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 22. Col. 3. 18. 1. Pet. 3.</note> in cheerefull obedience, in meekeneſſe of ſpirit, and in ſympathizing with her husband in proſperity and aduerſity. But where is the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? where is this <hi>Sarah,</hi> this <hi>Rebeccah?</hi> Shee will anſwer perhaps, Where there is an <hi>Abraham,</hi> and an <hi>Iſaac;</hi> for a good husband will make a good wife; a good <hi>Iohn,</hi> a good <hi>Ioane:</hi> the body will obey, where the head knoweth how to rule well.</p>
                  <p>II. That <hi>good and truely louing wiues loue their husbands parents for their husbands ſake,</hi> as theſe did <hi>Naomi.</hi> For the wife and husband are one, and ſhould be of one heart, and the one loue,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1830:30"/> vvhere the other liketh: and a good vvife ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to pleaſe and content her husband, in ſhevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loue to his friends.

                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is it ſaid that ſhee had no ſonnes moe for them to marry? why ſhould ſhee thus ſpeake to them?</hi> We muſt know that it was a Law among the Iewes, that a brother ſhould raiſe vp ſeede to a brother, who left a wife, and dyed childleſſe, Deut. 25. 5. Gen. 38. 8, 11. To which Law and practice her ſpeech alludeth. And by this wee may thinke it very likely, that theſe women were taught in the Law of God, and made acquainted with the practice of Gods people. This is very probable, becauſe <hi>Naomi</hi> was ſo godly a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone; and it appeareth by <hi>Ruths</hi> vertues: which being ſo, it commendeth the care of <hi>Naomi</hi> and her ſonnes, for the ſoules of theſe young women, borne of Idolaters out of the Church, to teach them the Law of the true God. A good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for parents to follow, and for husbands; for fathers and mothers; See Pro. 4. 3, 4. Deut. 6. 7.

But alas, many are ſo ignorant, as they cannot teach them, and many ſo careleſſe, as they neglect them, many ſo wretched, as they will not, and ſome ſo prophane, as they mocke at it, and hold it no duety for them, but for the Prieſt (as in ſcorne they call the Miniſter of Chriſt) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>

                     <hi>For I am too old to haue an husband.</hi>] This reaſon is a preuenting of an obiection to her former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: for they might ſay, Though, mother, you be not with child now, yet you may marry and haue children; to this <hi>Naomi</hi> anſwereth, that ſhee is too old to haue an husband. From this we learne,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1830:37"/> that <hi>there is a time when women are too old to marry,</hi> by the opinion of godly <hi>Naomi.</hi> Now if any aske when that is? I anſwer, as I ſuppoſe, when a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is aboue ſixtie yeeres of age; and therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alloweth ſuch a one for a widow, but not vnder, giuing leaue to others to marry: for vnder ſixtie women haue had children, but none aboue, but <hi>Sarahs</hi> extraordinary bleſſing. And it is fit for women after ſixtie, to follow the praiſe of bleſſed <hi>Annah,</hi> Luk. 1. 37. We read not in the Scripture of the marriage of ſuch: and if they be poore among vs, and doe marry, we diſlike it, and ſpeake againſt it: if they alledge the ends of marriage, they are eaſily anſwered: For the firſt is for procreation of children, which in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is paſt; the other is to auoid fornication, which they ſhould be farre from; ſeeing the body is dead, the heart ſhould not grow ranke with filthy luſt: the lecherous old perſon is hated of God. If they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to marry for mutuall comfort: I aske, With whom will ſhee marry for ſuch comfort? If with a yong man, ſhee may perhaps comfort her ſelfe in him, but not he himſelfe with her: for yong men marry old womens goods and lands, but not their perſons; there is in nature no accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, her wanton heart may ſeeke her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in matching with him, but he will take no contentment in her, but for what ſhee hath. If with an old man: where is comfort, when two froward old perſons meet together? old age, all know, is hard to pleaſe, and therefore old perſons can hardly afford kind comforts one to another.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1830:38"/> Laſtly, marriage bringeth cares and troubles, 1. Cor. 7. ſaith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Now it is time for old women to lay aſide the cares of this world, and to giue themſelues to faſting and prayer, and to doe good workes, and ſo to ſhew their care for the world to come. And therefore let ſuch widowes continue widowes, &amp; betake themſelues to God and his diuine worſhip, as beſt befitteth them.</p>

So they ſhewed herein great kindneſſe to trauell ſo farre with her, or that it was farre on the day before they came forth, if this was the firſt night: or elſe ſhee ſpeaketh thus, for that mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was conſummated at night. Here ſome may aske, why needed <hi>Naomi</hi> thus to ſpeake of her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an husband and bearing of children, ſeeing ſhee knew that the next kinſman was to doe the office for the dead? Chap. 3. 1, 2. Shee might haue ſaid, Your husbands haue kinſmen, which by our Law are to marry you, if you will goe with me, though I haue no ſonnes my ſelfe. <hi>Naomi</hi> knew
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1830:38"/> this well enough, as it appeareth afterwards, but firſt ſhee will not draw them to the Lords people with ſuch carnall reaſons; againe, ſhee knew not, perhaps, now, whether ſuch were dead or aliue; if aliue, yet they might be marryed, and ſo could not take them for wiues: if vnmarryed, ſhee yet knew not whether they would ſubmit to the Law in that caſe. For we ſee that what God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was not euer obeyed, and the Story telleth vs that one kinſman, Chap. 4. refuſed her; and why not another? And therefore, becauſe ſhee could not ſpeake any thing of certainty on which they might depend, ſhee mentioneth no ſuch thing: ſhewing this, that <hi>the wiſe will not make promiſes raſhly for others, nor perſwade to more then they well know,</hi> leſt they be deceiued, and ſo alſo deceiue others relying vpon their word.

And this is to be obſerued for the due accompliſhment of marriage, and for reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Gods ordinance; which checketh thoſe parents, who for other ends then the ends of marriage, doe match their children together before they be marriageable. Here parents abuſe marriage; for this is no coniunction for procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <hi>Vnto her people.</hi>] That is, to the Moabites, of whom ſhee was, and among whom ſhee was borne. Shee was going to Gods people, but ſhee runeth backe to Idolaters, becauſe ſhee was of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1830:46"/> them, there borne, as I ſay, and acquainted with them. <hi>It is hard to forſake our natiue Countrey, where we are borne and brought vp.</hi> This may we ſee in <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> and in the mixt company which came out of Egypt; thither would they haue returned againe, though there they had liued in bondage; and this is firſt from a naturall inſtinct in euery one, euen as the Heathen man witneſſeth.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And to her gods.</hi>] This is a check vnto <hi>Orpha:</hi> in which <hi>Naomi</hi> doth cloſely ſhew vnto <hi>Ruth,</hi> her ſiſters miſery in going backe, which was, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Idols, and Deuils, with the people of her countrey, ſeeing ſhee now had none to keepe her backe from the ſame. Hence note briefely,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>to leaue Gods people, to goe to dwell among Idolaters, is euen to become an Idolater;</hi> For the loue of Idolaters will bring to the loue of their Idols:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1830:46"/> ſee it in <hi>Salomon,</hi> and in <hi>Iehoram Iehoſaphats</hi> ſonne: for ſuch haue dayly prouocations to that, which indeed they be of their owne natures prone vnto: and therefore the Lord did forbid his people to haue any fellowſhip with the Nations, leſt they ſhould become Idolaters. Therefore let vs not come among Idolaters, if we would not be like them: we may not preſume of our owne ſtrength, nor thinke by our grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dednes in Religion, to take our liberty to marry with them, to dwell with them, or long to trauell among them; for we ſee dayly by experience, the vanity of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That <hi>what the Idolaters worſhip, that they take to be God, and ſo offer diuine worſhip to it.</hi> This is plaine by <hi>Naomi</hi> her ſpeech, calling the Idols of the Moabites, Gods; &amp; we find that all Idolaters gaue to their Idols the name of God. See this in wicked <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> 1. King. 12. 28. and in the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Exod. 32. 8. And therefore we may here ſee the palpable blindneſſe with which God ſtriketh ſuch, to make vs auoid them, and yet bemoane them, as alſo to feare where ſuch be, leſt Gods wrath ſeaze vpon vs, for their ſo robbing the true God of his honour.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That <hi>Idolaters haue moe gods than one,</hi> as theſe Moabites had, <hi>Baal Peor,</hi> Num. 25. and <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſh,</hi> 1 Kin. 11. The Grecians had thouſands of gods; and the Heathen Romanes not a few: for leauing or not knowing the true God, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they know not whither, they haue no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty whereon to reſt, they follow what they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imagine, or other doe deuiſe, or what by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1830:47"/> examples are practiſed before them; ſee it in the Iſraelites forſaking the Lord, and in the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Papiſts at this day. For idolatrie is as whoredom, which maketh the Adulterer to range abroad in vnſatiable luſt, not content with one, no nor with many: no more doe the ſpirituall Adulterers reſt with one falſe god, but are mad vpon all they ſee, Ezech. 16. 24, 25, 28. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs prayſe our God, who hath opened our eyes to ſee and know him, and hath deliuered vs from this miſerable ſlauery of Idolaters, who ſerue ſo many! they muſt needs be in great feare: for they be as ſeruants ſeruing many maſters, all tyrants and all of ſeuerall qualities; how ſhould they then euer reſt in peace? Note before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, how theſe Moabites, filthy Idolaters, were the children of <hi>Lot,</hi> begotten in inceſt vpon one of his owne daughters in his drunkenneſſe. Whence we may ſee, that <hi>the ill begotten children of the godly are rather left vnder the curſe of their fathers ſinne, then made partakers of any of their vertues,</hi> as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both in Moabites and Ammonites, and in <hi>Abimelech</hi> the baſtard ſonne of <hi>Gideon;</hi> to ſhew the Lords hatred of all filthineſſe in his people, and to ſtrike feare into their hearts for offending this way. Let Parents note this, to take heed they be not fathers of an vnlawfull iſſue, if it be not for their owne ſakes, yet for thoſe they ſhall beget, whom they bring vnder a curſe, for their ſinne. Let baſtards here learne to bewaile their birth, and labour by a new birth according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to wipe out the ſtaine of their parentage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1830:47"/> to the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turne thee after thy ſiſter in law.</hi>] This exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be taken as ſeriouſly meant: for would <hi>Naomi</hi> perſwade <hi>Ruth</hi> to idolatrie, and turne her from going to Gods people and the true God, to goe to the ſociety of Idolaters and to deuils? We may not poſſibly thinke ſo vncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably of her, and the 18. verſe putteth it out of controuerſie, where it is ſaid, When ſhee ſaw <hi>Ruth ſtedfaſtly minded,</hi> ſhe left off to ſpeake, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing found out what ſhee ſought for, and till then ſhee ceaſed not to make triall. For <hi>where iuſt ſuſpicion of vnſoundneſse is, there triall may be made to the vtmoſt, till the doubt be remoued:</hi> For this is not to beate the parties from goodneſſe, but to ſee their vnfeigned loue of goodneſſe, that they being tried, may be well approued of. Let not any be offended then at ſuch tryals; for if thou beeſt ſound, the oftener thou art brought to the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, the more purer gold thou wilt appeare to be.</p>

Let vs then hold ſuch for our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries; and not thinke as the men of the world do, who hold all their kind friends which any way pleaſure the body, though they be Aduerſaries to their ſoules, in hindering them in the way to life and ſaluation, by perſwading them to pleaſures vnlawful, to vniuſt gaine, to a falſe religion &amp; ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous worſhip, as Popery is: But in theſe harme, things, becauſe they be blind and ſee not their harme, they therefore thinke not that ſuch be againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when yet there be no greater Aduerſaries then theſe. The ſecond reading is as it is tranſlated, <hi>Intreat me not to leaue thee.</hi> And thus taking the words, we learne from this godly yong woman, that <hi>the godly haue a deſire not to be hindred in a good courſe. Ruth</hi> was going from Idolaters to the Church of God, and was in loue with <hi>Naomi,</hi> whom ſhe would accompany thither, and would not be intreated to forſake her; no more would <hi>Eliſha</hi> leaue <hi>Eliah.</hi> The godly are like to <hi>Ahimaaz,</hi> who would not be let for running to <hi>Dauid:</hi> for,

                     <hi>Or to turne from following after thee.</hi>] As if ſhee had ſaid, Vſe no more words to hinder my honeſt intendement, but goe on that I may follow thee: let my ſiſter in law goe to her people and gods too; her example moueth me not one whit, I will goe with thee to thy people and to thy God: I haue taſted by thee of true Religion, the power whereof and thy vertues ſo bind me, as I can leaue all, countrey, kindred, &amp; friends, and old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, to follow thee, my mother. See here,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. How <hi>Religion and grace maketh ſuch as be of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1830:49"/> ſeuerall nations, to loue one another; to loue forrainers being religious, better then friends, kindred and old acquaintance not religious. Ruth</hi> is in loue with <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi</hi> a <hi>Iew,</hi> and eſteemeth not of <hi>Orpha</hi> her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey woman; for, indeed, Religion maketh a more ſure coniunction, in a more bleſſed kindred then nature, hauing God for our Father, the Church for our Mother, the Saints for our Brethren, the Spirit of God for the bond of our vnion, which maketh vs to deſire to liue and die together. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for this loue, the loue of the brethren, before naturall loue of friends not religious; for this is a true ſigne of our eternall ſaluation, and that we<note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.</note> be tranſlated from death to life.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>A heart truely in loue with the godly, will not eaſily be remoued to forſake them, by the falling away of others;</hi> as we may ſee by this example: By <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> cleauing to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the Diſciples conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing<note place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> with Chriſt, though others forſooke him. And this is, becauſe their loue is well grounded: for they know the godly to be in their perſons honorable; how baſely ſoeuer the ſlaues of <hi>Satan</hi> eſteeme of them, they know them to be Kings, and Prieſts vnto God. They diſcerne of their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and are in loue with them for the ſame, yea, they hauing the ſame Spirit, doe by the force thereof knit themſelues to them: and doe know<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 37.</note> that their end is happineſſe, whatſoeuer their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate be in this vale of miſerie. Let vs cleaue then to theſe, though others doe fall away; and that we may ſo doe, let vs not take offence at their weakeneſſes and frailties, but conſider of their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1830:50"/> loue with God, of their excellent graces, and how that holy Spirit of God dwelleth in them, that they be ſuch as be Coheires with Chriſt, and ſhall reigne with him in glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For whither thou goeſt, I will goe, and where thou lodgeſt, I will lodge.</hi>] This is the reaſon of <hi>Ruths</hi> requeſt to <hi>Naomi</hi> from her reſolution, which is, not to forſake her company, but to goe with her, and to lodge with her, whereſoeuer ſhee ſhall lodge; this is her reſolution, which made her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with <hi>Ruth,</hi> and not ſtart backe. Whence note, That <hi>the putting on of a ſtrong reſolution, will make one withſtand all oppoſitions and hinderances, which may lie in the way, to be lets from well-doing.</hi> This made <hi>Michaiah</hi> to doe faithfully the Lords meſſage, 2. Kin. 22. This made S. <hi>Paul</hi> to go on to Ieruſalem without daunt of Spirit, Acts 20. 24. with 21. 31. for a grounded reſolution is ſuch a ſettling of thy heart, as it cannot eaſily be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Let vs therefore put on this reſolution, in making an onſet to goodneſſe, and in euery good action, ſeeing there may be many hinderances in the way: and to doe this, that our hearts ſtart not backe, wee muſt make our reſolution ſtrong by theſe things; wee muſt ſee that the thing wee take in hand, be good &amp; lawfull; then, whether lawfull to vs, and what calling we haue thereto: thirdly, to weigh the circumſtances of time and place, ſo that it may bee done ſeaſonably and fitly. This is prudence, which will much commend the deede. Fourthly, note with our ſelues the end, Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, publike good, diſcharge of our duety, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1830:50"/> of ſiniſter reſpects. Laſtly, forecaſt all rubbes which may happen in the way; for ſuch foreſight fore-warneth, and hee which is fore-warned, is halfe armed, and will not repent with an Had I wiſt; neither will be moued with ſuch lets, Acts 20. 24. Note againe from hence, that <hi>Ruth</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not againſt any condition which may befall <hi>Naomi;</hi> but will goe with her, and take ſuch part as ſhee taketh, whether the lodging be good or bad; whether the place be comfortable, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whither <hi>Naomi</hi> ſhall goe. Which example telleth vs, that <hi>ſuch as truly loue the godly, both can and will giue themſelues to them, to accompany them in euery eſtate,</hi> not onely in proſperity, but in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, as did <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe they know that God is with them, Zach. 8. 23. they account themſelues one, and are of one heart, &amp; hauing giuen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the Lord, they cannot but giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to his people, 2. Cor. 8. 5. And therefore if wee doe loue the godly, keepe them company, and forſake them not in their aduerſity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thy people ſhall bee my people.</hi>] Shee loueth a good woman, her mother in law <hi>Naomi;</hi> and thereby giueth her ſelfe to the loue of all Gods people: for <hi>they that loue one godly perſon for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe ſake, cannot but affect all the Lords flocke:</hi> for there is the like reaſon to all, as to one in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: and the ſame Spirit that vniteth the heart of one godly perſon to another, vniteth the ſame to all the reſt, as being together members of Chriſts myſticall body. This may trie our true loue to euery godly perſon, by our true loue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1830:51"/> the ſome ground to all the reſt: for elſe that particular loue will not be found to be other then ſiniſter. <hi>Dauids</hi> delight was not in one Saint, but in the <hi>Saints,</hi> that dwell vpon the earth. True it is, that by a priuate familiarity, and particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with one more than another, the loue may more ſhew it ſelfe, as in reaſon it muſt and will: yet ſuch a loue vpon occaſion will truly ſhew it ſelfe to all others, which are vnited in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the ſame truth, and will be ready to doe them good when ſuch are knowne, as it euer doth wiſh you well, before there be any acquaintance at all. And if one godly perſon by a vertuous life may not onely procure loue to him or her ſelfe, but alſo to all other of Gods people, this ſhould make vs ſo to demeane our ſelues euery one of vs, as wee may ſo winne others to vs, as alſo the ſame perſons vnto the reſt which feare God, for the encreaſe of Gods Kingdome, and ſo the haſtening of Chriſts appearing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And thy God, my God.</hi>] As ſhee leaueth her owne people being Idolaters, for Gods people, ſo ſhee renounceth her Idols for the true God: for <hi>they which truly for godlineſſe ſake embrace Gods people, cannot but then intertaine the true God, and leaue their Idols,</hi> 1. Theſ. 1. 6, 9. As <hi>Ruth</hi> did here, and <hi>Rahab</hi> alſo: becauſe the loue of godlineſſe in men, ariſeth from the loue of God himſelfe, the Author of that goodneſſe in his people. The Corinthians gaue firſt themſelues to the Lord,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 5. Zach. 8. 23.</note> then to his Seruants: and <hi>Zacharie</hi> foretelleth that the Heathen hauing heard of the Lord to be
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1830:51"/> among the Iewes, they will then come and deſire to be with them. Trie our loue to the godly by a ſound intertainement of their Religion, elſe the loue is but carnall, worldly, or counterfeit; for in<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6. 14.</note> differing religions, there neither is nor can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true concord: and therefore let vs not thinke that either Idolaters, Atheiſts, or irreligious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can be any faithfull louers of the truth. Note againe, that <hi>godly perſons may by their godlines draw</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16. 1. Pet. 3. 1. and 2. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>others vnto the embracing of the true God;</hi> either by inſtruction, or by a holy conuerſation, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both together; And therefore let vs labour by our godlineſſe in doctrine and life, ſo to ſet foorth the Lords praiſes, as wee may gaine others vnto him. This is our duty, Mat. 5. 16. this is Chriſtian-like carriage, which becommeth well the Saints; this will winne ſoules to God, and ſo couer the multitude of ſinnes, bee an aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Lords name, and bring comfort to our owne ſoules in the Day of Ieſus Chriſt. It may be, ſome will aske, Whether for meere loue to the perſon of any, if one intertaine Religion, he may be iuſtified in ſo doing? Surely no: One may occaſion another, or be a motiue thereto, and ſo performe a good office on his part; but Religion is to bee beloued and imbraced for it ſelfe, and not for mans ſake; the perſon on whom a man relieth, may die, or turne backe from the truth, and become ſuch a ground as the ſand, on which an houſe being built, ſoone decayeth, and the fall thereof is great.</p>

Then let all prepare to die, at one time, or at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which ſtands in ſeeking reconciliation with God in Chriſt, &amp; in endeuouring to keepe a good conſcience before God &amp; man, Act. 24. 16. vvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the time of diſſolution, which the men of pleaſures, as <hi>Diues;</hi> the vvorldly-minded, as the rich man; the drowſie proteſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like the fiue foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Virgins, and ſuch as go on ſecurely, as thoſe in the old vvorld, and in Sodom, Mat. 24. 37, 38, 39. doe not.

They loue one another for their graces in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly reſpects, and therefore by a ſpirituall bond they are vnited in heart, and made one. Thus ſhould vvee loue, and thus ſettle it, that it may abide to death: and that vvee may ſo loue, let vs remember, that vve be Children of one Father, vvee be brethren, vvee be very members of the ſame body, and Chriſt Ieſus our Head, vvee alſo are here ſtrangers; and if vvee loue not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vvho vvill loue vs? for the vvorld hateth vs,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15. 19.</note> There be which would be held Chriſtians, and yet cannot loue ſuch as be ſo indeede. <hi>Cain</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loue <hi>Abel,</hi> though his brother; nor <hi>Eſau</hi> a <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> Some profeſſe to loue the godly, but it is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterly, not ſimply for their graces and vertues, as <hi>Ruth</hi> here loued <hi>Naomi,</hi> for no other cauſe of loue could there be; for <hi>Ruth</hi> was young, and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi</hi> old, and very poore.

                     <hi>And there will I be buried.] Ruth</hi> ſpoken before of their death, and now of their buriall together: ſo as neither in life nor death, ſhee would bee ſeparated from her mother. By this it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>buriall was a duty performed to the dead then, as now,</hi> and therefore ſhee ſpeaketh of it, as hoping that it would be performed to them, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alwaies haue done one for another ſucceſſiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Abraham</hi> for <hi>Sarah; Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> their father: ſo <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> for <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Yea wee reade how God himſelfe buryed <hi>Moſes:</hi> and with what ſolemnities burials were performed, wee may ſee by the embalming of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his carrying into Canaan with ſuch troups, and the mourning there made for him diuers daies. The godly would not neglect this to <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, to Chriſt crucified, and to <hi>Steuen</hi> ſtoned. It is humanity, it is an honeſt and good reſpect vnto the dead, and done by beleeuers alſo in the hope of the reſurrection. It was eſteemed a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be buried, and the contrary was threatned as a puniſhment, as wee may ſee in 1. King. 13. 14.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1830:53"/> 2. King. 9. 22. and 22. 20. Deut. 28. 26. Ier. 18. Yet we muſt know, that a <hi>Diues</hi> may be buried with pompe, and yet go to hel; and a poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> be exalted to heauen; yea many Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs drowned, torne of beaſts, and burnt to aſhes, yet receiued the crowne of glory: which I ſpeake to ſhew, that although the godly ſhould want buriall, yet that hindeteth not their happineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. We may ſee hence, that <hi>the godly and louing friends haue an affection to bee buried together. Iacob</hi> would lye where <hi>Abraham</hi> was buryed: &amp; the old<note place="margin">2. Sam. 19. 37. 1. King. 13. 31.</note> Prophet would haue his bones laid by the other Prophet. And it was in former times an honour, to bee buryed in the Sepulchre of their fathers: And therefore the louing affection of ſuch is not to be blamed as altogether idle &amp; fooliſh, which deſire to be buryed by their beloued friends, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they were godly and vertuous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord doe ſo to me, and more alſo.</hi>] When <hi>Ruth</hi> ſaw <hi>Naomi</hi> ſo earneſt to haue her to returne backe, as ſhee thought; for her better ſatisfaction and aſſurance, ſhee thus breaketh forth into this ſpeech, aſcertaining her, that her words came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a true affection a and conſtant reſolution of her heart. This is a forme of an oath among the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes: for ſo it is ſaid, that <hi>Salomon</hi> ſwore, 1. Ki. 2. 23. And thus ſwore <hi>Saul,</hi> 1.

                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>it is lawfull to take an oath,</hi> Heb. 6. 13.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1830:54"/> Reue. 10. 6. it is warranted, Deut. 6. and a part of Gods worſhip which he will giue to none other: it is neceſſary ſometime to decide a controuerſie, as Exo. 22. 11. and to giue ſatisfaction and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the mind of others, in great and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matters which otherwiſe would not bee credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as here; Therefore the Anabaptiſts erre, which hold it altogether vnlawfull: for it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſweare, being thereto called before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; ſo <hi>Abraham</hi> made his ſeruant to ſweare, Gen. 24. and <hi>Aſa</hi> made his ſubiects to take an oath, 2. Chro. 15. ſo <hi>Ezra,</hi> Chap. 10. and <hi>Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> Chap. 13. It is lawfull to ſweare for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a truth in weightie matters one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the ſpies ſwore to <hi>Rahab; Dauid</hi> and <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> one to another; <hi>Dauid</hi> to <hi>Bethſheba, Ruth</hi> here to <hi>Naomi:</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did often call God to witneſſe for the glory of God, and the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Goſpell. We may therefore lawfully take an oath, ſo it be <hi>in truth,</hi> not a lye, not with an equiuocation, or mentall reſeruation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue; <hi>in righteouſneſſe,</hi> that the matter be iuſt, and <hi>in iudgement,</hi> knowing well the thing, and vpon mature deliberation and ſettled perſwaſion of the truth. Beware of common and vſuall ſwearing, the cuſtome thereof maketh it worſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth the man to be vnreformed in his heart, yea though the thing be true, which he ſweareth. A man ſhould be ſo honeſt, and his word in ſuch eſteeme, as his oath ſhould not neede in ordinary matters; And as we muſt take heede of common ſwearing, ſo when we are to ſweare, let it bee in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1830:54"/> truth, righteouſneſſe and iudgement: take heede of periury, which God wil reuenge, Ezech. 5. Yea he ſweareth to reuenge it, Ezech. 17. 16, 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That <hi>the godly when they ſweare, they ſweare by God:</hi> if they doe otherwiſe, it is their fault. When the Angel ſware, Reu. 10. 6. it was by God: ſo was the oath of <hi>Dauid, Ionathan,</hi> and others: we are taught by God himſelfe, to ſweare by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Heb. 6. and this will giue ſatisfaction, for that God can beare witneſſe, and the calling of him to witneſſe, worketh a credit in the party to whom another doth ſweare: ſuch is the reuerence of Gods name in mens hearts. Hee can reuenge periury, and it is his will that wee ſhould ſweare onely by him, Deut. 4. &amp; 10. Exo. 23. We are not therefore to ſweare by falſe gods, as did <hi>Iezabel</hi> by her gods, 1. King 19. Ioſ. 23. 7. Pſal. 16. 4. Zeph. 1. 5. nor by them that are no Gods, Ier. 5. 7. Amos 8. 14. nor by the creatures, Mat. 5. 35, 36. for ſuch ſwearers take Gods honour from him, and make theſe things by which they ſweare, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols: they breake the Lords Commandement, and prouoke Gods wrath againſt them. <hi>Ruth</hi> a new Conuert, would not ſweare by the Idols of her countrey: for if ſhee had, it would not haue ſatiſfied <hi>Naomi,</hi> and ſhe had ſhewed, that ſhe had not beene conuerted to the true God; whereas now ſhee declared, that ſhee worſhipped the true God.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That <hi>euery oath is with an execration, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnderſtood, or expreſſed,</hi> as here in generall tearmes, &amp; elſe where they are conioyned, Neh.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1830:55"/> 10. 29. for an oath is a calling of God to witneſſe in a matter ſo, as to bleſſe him, if he ſpeake truth; or to plague him, if hee ſpeake the contrary. This ſhould make men take heede how they do ſweare, leſt they bring a curſe vpon themſelues, as did <hi>Zedekiah;</hi> and <hi>Vladiſlaus,</hi> King of Hungarie, and <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> D. of Sueuia, when he rebelled againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour his Lord and maſter, by the inſtigation of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV.

                  <p>HEre is the force and effect of <hi>Ruths</hi> reſolution vpon <hi>Naomi,</hi> and withall the very drift of <hi>Naomi</hi> her ſpeeches to <hi>Ruth,</hi> concerning her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backe, only for triall of her conſtancie; which when ſhee ſaw, ſhee ceaſed to ſpeake thereof any more vnto <hi>Ruth.</hi> So as here is to be noted: Firſt, the ſilence of <hi>Naomi.</hi> Secondly, the cauſe thereof.

                     <hi>When ſhe ſaw.</hi>] That is, when ſhe perceiued her full reſolution, then ſhe admitted of her fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but not before; whence, and from whoſe wiſedome we learne, That <hi>the godly wiſe are warie in their admittance of others into their company, till
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1830:56"/> they well know them.</hi> Wee ſee the wiſdome of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi> Chap. 6. 2, 11, 12. of <hi>Iacob,</hi> when <hi>Eſau</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him kindneſſe, and of <hi>Dauid</hi> towards <hi>Saul;</hi> though he both wept, and ſpake him faire, hee kept off from him; neither would our Sauiour commit himſelfe to all his followers, Ioh. 2. 24. for mans heart is deceitfull, and a ſhew may bee made of that, which is not in the heart indeede: therefore ſhould wee learne Chriſts counſell, to be as wiſe as Serpents, with a Doues innocencie, leſt like a well-meaning <hi>Gedaliah</hi> without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of euill in others, becauſe wee intend none euill in our ſelues, we periſh by hypocriticall <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maels,</hi> Ier. 41. 6. Let vs in theſe fraudulent times, trie, know, and ſo approue and admit, or diſlike and leaue men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That ſhee was ſtedfaſtly minded to goe with her.</hi>] This is it which held <hi>Ruths</hi> ſtedfaſt ſpirit; ſhe was not of a light and vnſtable heart. But how ſavv <hi>Naomi</hi> this in her? By <hi>Ruths</hi> conſtant abyding by her promiſe expreſſing her minde, and by her ſolemne oath confirming the ſame promiſe. So then, <hi>words with an oath, and actions agreeing, ſufficiently may perſwade vs of the ſtedfaſtneſſe of the heart, and the inward diſpoſition of the minde of ſuch as ſhew themſeules vertuous.</hi> And with this ſhould wee reſt ſatiffied, as <hi>Naomi</hi> doth here, as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the next words; for charity bindeth vs to thinke the beſt of ſuch teſtimonies, of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, oathes and actions concurring. True it is, that all theſe may be feigned: for wicked men will promiſe, ſweare, and in ſome ſort doe, but yet not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1830:56"/> ſo, as they bee free from guile therein: they will promiſe what they truly intend not; they will ſweare, to be the better credited, and leſſe diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, euen when they meane to deceiue, becauſe they feare not God; and in ſome things they will be doing, in ſuch things as may rather delude, than indeede effect what they pretend, but not what they ſecretly intend. Such Machiauellians, or rather matchleſſe villaines there bee in the world. But I ſpake before of ſuch as feare God, who are to be beleeued, when they take an oath to ſhew the truth of the heart, in that which they doe ſpeake. But that we may reſt ſatisfied with an oath, wee muſt obſerue theſe things in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: firſt, ſee to his life, whether ſuch a one feare God; then, whether hee make conſcience of an oath, or be an ordinary ſwearer, not regarding an oath: and thirdly, what doth make him to ſweare, whether it be hope of gaine, ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards him, or feare, or ſome ſuddaine paſſion, and not a religious ground: as theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, ſo may wee beleeue, or doubt. The words tranſlated (<hi>was ſtedfaſtly minded</hi>) are in Hebrew, <hi>Shee ſtrengthened her ſelfe,</hi> to wit, by her oath. By which we may learne, that <hi>an oath is the ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the mind of him that ſweareth to doe that which he hath ſworne to doe;</hi> if it bee lawfull, and that the oath was not raſhly taken. Thus <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſtrengthned himſelfe not to leaue <hi>Eliah</hi> till he was taken vp; and <hi>Michaiah</hi> to performe faithfully his miniſterie, before and vnto <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he came thither, where he was. And this is lawfull ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1830:57"/> in great and weighty affaires. Wherein wee may feare the fainting of our hearts, then with prayer to God to vow our obedience, and if iuſt cauſe require, to vvitneſſe by oath our reſolution, as <hi>Ruth</hi> doth here, and the reſt before named. But when we haue ſworne lawfully, then let vs looke to it, that we doe not breake it, Pſal. 15. Ioſh. 9. 19. for God will require it at our hands, except it be like <hi>Herods</hi> oath; it is then better broken, and to be repented of, rather than kept.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſhe left ſpeaking vnto her.</hi>] To wit, of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning backe againe, and of willing her to goe after <hi>Orpha</hi> vnto her owne Countrey and people; and ſhe left off, becauſe ſhe ſaw that <hi>Ruth</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to go with her, without ſiniſter and by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, for that <hi>Ruth</hi> could not by ſuch reaſons as ſhe had laid before her, be made to depart from her, being an old poore woman and ſtranger, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Orpha</hi> did leaue her. So then hence note, that <hi>there is no reaſon to make further triall, where an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, reſolution is, or may be well diſcerned:</hi> for this were folly, and alſo vncharitableneſſe, to call ſtill into queſtion that which is out of queſtion, and to ſuſpect an honeſt mind, which fully ſheweth it ſelfe, as far as it can for the preſent. Let vs then learne this wiſdome, ſo to trie before we truſt, and then to truſt after ſound triall; for this is the end therof. Againe, where we ſee the mind ſettled to well-doing, let vs not put it to further triall then neede is, leſt we doe weaken the parties faith, and bring the mind into wauering, but leaue him to his honeſt reſolution, Act. 21. 14. 1. Cor. 16. 12.</p>

                     <hi>Verſe 19.</hi> So they two went vntill they came to Bethlehem: and it came to paſſe, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the Citie was moued about them, and they ſaid, Is this <hi>Naomi?</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN the ſixth verſe they tooke their iourney, and after ſtood parleying by the way; now they goe forward till they came to the end thereof; ſo as here is ſhewed how long they did iourney, and whither, and then what was the euent when they came there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So they two went vntill they came to Bethlehem.</hi>] When <hi>Naomi</hi> had tried her, ſhe tooke her to her, and ſo ſhee poore woman returneth into her Countrey, left of all except this one; ſhee was forſaken, but not of all; one goeth with her, and they two poore women goe together, and left not off, till they did come vnto Bethlehem. Whence obſerue,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>they are to bee admitted into our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, whom wee find to be conſtant in a good courſe, and true louers of goodneſſe, whatſoeuer they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Naomi</hi> thus admits of <hi>Ruth</hi> no doubt, with great comfort. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> alloweth of Marke, 2. Tim. 4. 11. though before hee had refuſed him, Act. 15. 38. and willeth others to entertaine him, Col. 4. 10, 11. For thus Gods Angels deale with vs; they will account vs their fellow-ſeruants whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we turne to God, though before we were neuer ſo lewd, yea they will reioyce ouer vs, and will lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly attend vs: let vs then admit of ſuch, as God
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1830:58"/> alſo himſelfe doth accept of vs.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That <hi>God leaueth not his in diſtreſſe, or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether comfortleſſe. Naomi</hi> went out with husband and children, and loſt them: ſhee returneth not alone, but God ſent her one to accompany her, and to comfort her. And where mans company to helpe and comfort faileth, there God will ſend his Angels, as with <hi>Iacob</hi> in his trauell to Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia, and with the three children in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace; Yea God will ſtand by <hi>Paul,</hi> when all men forſake him, 2. Tim. 4. becauſe hee knoweth our frailty and weakeneſſe, and therefore will not leaue his altogether comfortleſſe, that their faith ſhould not faile: which to thinke vpon, is not a ſmall comfort vnto Gods people in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and troubles.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That <hi>a true reſolution will ſhew it ſelfe in a full execution.</hi> Shee reſolued to goe with <hi>Naomi,</hi> and ſo ſhee did, till ſhee came to Bethlehem. <hi>Iacob</hi> vowed, and ſo reſolued in his returne from Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia, to build an Altar to God at Bethel, and ſo he did, Gen. 18, and 35. Yet this is ſo to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, if forcible impediments hinder not, as we may ſee in <hi>Pauls</hi> will to goe to the Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which yet he did not then, becauſe <hi>Satan</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him, 1. Theſ. 2. 18. By this may we learne to know the difference betweene ſolid reſolutions and ſuddaine flaſhes, raw and vndigeſted purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, betweene true reſolutions, and ſuch as be made in ſhew, but in ſubſtance proue nothing ſo, neuer ſeene in the effects.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. In this their trauell to Canaan, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1830:58"/> to Bethlehem, note three things: their <hi>vnity, feruencie,</hi> and <hi>conſtancie;</hi> they went together lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly, they ceaſed not to goe on, they did not linger, they tooke no by-paths, neither forgate they whither they were going, till they came vnto Bethlehem in Canaan. As theſe thus went to Canaan, ſo ſhould we vnto the ſpirituall Canaan, and heauenly Bethlehem: we muſt goe in vnity, 1. Cor. 1. 10. and be of one heart, Act. 1. 14. and 2. 1, 46. and 4. 24. in a godly feruency, Rom. 12. 11. Tit. 2. 14. Ezech. 3. 14. as <hi>Eliah, Nehemiah,</hi> the Angel of Epheſus, Reuel. 2. 1, 2. and as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whom the zeale of Gods houſe had eaten vp. And we muſt goe in a conſtant Spirit, and not be weary of well-doing, Gal. 6. for he that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth to the end, ſhall be ſaued. To conclude the obſeruations from theſe words, note how Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem, the houſe of bread, yea Canaan, a land flowing with milke and hony, and no lacke in it, Deut. 7. 8, 9. and 11. 9, 11, 12. and 27. 3. was made ſo barren, as <hi>Naomi</hi> was faine to goe into Moab for reliefe, and yet now is made fruitfull againe, anſwerable to the name. Whence ſee, how <hi>the Lord can make a fruitfull land barren,</hi> Pſal. 107. 33, 34. <hi>for the ſinnes of the people, and againe can turne barrenneſſe into plenty, of his mercy and goodneſſe,</hi> Pſal. 107. 35, 36. Therefore to haue the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Gods mercies, take heede of ſin: when we enioy them, prayſe him for them; &amp; when we be in ſcarcitie, ſeeke to him, becauſe God can helpe, Pſal. 65. 10, 11, 12. and he hath promiſed to giue a bleſſing, Eſay 41. 17, 18. 2. Chron. 7. 14. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1830:59"/> of murmuring in want, 1.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And it came to paſſe, when they were come to Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi>] Theſe words are a repetition of the former words immediately before. Thus plainely ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Holy Ghoſt, declaring the matter not in curiouſneſſe of ſpeech, but in euidence of the truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That all the city was moued about them.</hi>] That is, All the Inhabitants of the City. A figuratiue ſpeech, as in Mat. 2. 3. There was a generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming together to ſee them. Such a mouing is ſometime for feare, Mat. 2. 3. ſometime for ioy, 1. King. 1. 45. Mat. 21. 10. and of a wonderment, Act. 2. 6. All this noteth, that <hi>Naomi</hi> was not an obſcure perſon before, but a woman of fame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhee went; and therefore was this obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her returne, when ſhee now was come to Bethlehem. By which we may vnderſtand, that <hi>the more renowned any be in proſperity, the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable are they in a downefall and in aduerſity.</hi> This experience ſheweth to be true among our ſelues, by very late inſtances; for the eminency of ſuch in proſperity haue the eyes of many vpon them, friends, enemies, equals; one ſort lookes on with loue, another with hatred, the laſt with enuie and diſdaine; and as they be affected in a mans dayes of proſperity, ſo will they ſpeake and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1830:59"/> ſhew fully themſelues in aduerſity. This ſhould make ſuch as be ſet out ſo to the view of men, to behaue themſelues wiſely in euery eſtate, ſeeing they be ſo obſeruable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is this Naomi?</hi>] There be three opinions of this, and it may be, that the company being mixt and of all ſorts, they might ſpeake the ſame words, but with differing minds. Some thinke the words ſpoken in contempt, <hi>Is this Naomi?</hi>] Shee that was ſo faire and full, is ſhee now brought downe? If this may ſtand, we ſee, that <hi>pouerty bringeth contempt euen vpon the beſt.</hi> So was <hi>Iob</hi> contemned by baſe fellowes, Chap. 30. 1, 11. So was <hi>Dauid</hi> of <hi>Nabal,</hi> of <hi>Shemei,</hi> yea our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our vpon the croſſe. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of the poore as ſubiect to ſcorne and contempt, Prou. 17. 5. and 19. 4. which commeth through the want of heauenly wiſedome, Prou. 11. 12. the want of Gods feare, Iob 6. 14. and becauſe men in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity are proud, and doe ſiniſterly interpret of ſuch as be in aduerſity. Doth aduerſity bring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? Then let vs take heed how by our owne prodigality, folly, and wickedneſſe, we bring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill vpon our ſelues; if it be the immediate hand of God, and not thy fault, thou ſhalt be cenſured, as <hi>Iob</hi> was; how much more, when the cauſe is apparently from thy ſelfe? Againe, let men in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity prepare to beare contempt; and not be impatient, nor take it to heart; for <hi>Iob, Dauid,</hi> Chriſt Ieſus ſuffered it patiently. If men learne not patience in this, it will make them lay violent hands vpon themſelues, as <hi>Saul,</hi> who could not<note place="margin">1. Sam. 31. 14.</note>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:1830:60"/> endure contempt, and therefore would preuent it by killing himſelfe: for impatient proud hearts take contempt in aduerſity, to be worſe to them then death it ſelfe. Indeed to mocke or deſpiſe the miſerable, is an argument of the want of Gods feare, and that ſuch are vncharitable, cruell, and void of mercy, for whom there remaineth iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mercileſſe; yet howſoeuer the wickedly proud behaue themſelues we muſt in aduerſity be content. Some thinke the words to be ſpoken with admiration, Is this <hi>Naomi!</hi> as if it had beene ſaid, Oh what an alteration is here! And ſo taking the words, we learne, that <hi>ſtrange alterations in mens eſtates, make people to wonder whether it be in proſperity or aduerſity, for good or euill in any quality.</hi> The wiſe and learned friends of <hi>Iob</hi> were aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the change of his eſtate. <hi>Sauls</hi> conuerſion was wondred at, 1. Sam. 10. 11. So the gifts of the Apoſtles and miracles, Act. 2. 7. and 4. 13. and Chriſts wiſedome and learning being but twelue yeeres old; for men are more carryed away with the conſideration of the outward meanes how things came to paſſe, then of the power and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God to make ſuch an alteration. Therefore in great alterations looke for wonderings, and take no offence thereat; for it is mans nature ſo to doe at vnuſuall things: yea it is a certaine cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and folly in the vulgar ſort, who conſider not the cauſes of things. It could not but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what moue <hi>Naomi,</hi> to ſee ſuch a concourſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to come to wonder and gaze vpon them, as people doe at ſtrangers, or at others in a change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1830:60"/> eſtate, euen among our ſelues. But theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of people wee muſt paſſe by. Some thinke the words to be vttered from pitty and commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards her, as if it had beene ſaid, Is this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi?</hi> Alas, what a change is in her? This is that good woman <hi>Naomi,</hi> whom wee cannot yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, though in her eſtate ſhee bee much altered. And it is moſt like they ſpake in loue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, rather than in contempt, becauſe ſhee was the kinſwoman of the chiefeſt man among them, who, it ſeemeth, eſteemed much of her: for hee entertained <hi>Ruth</hi> kindly for her ſake, Chap. 2. 6, 11. and ſent her corne, Chap. 3. 17. likewiſe the women ſpoke after very comfortably to her, Chap. 4. 14, 16. neither doth <hi>Naomi</hi> taxe them for contemning her, but rather anſwereth to their eſteeme of her name from her former eſtate: and therefore this being vttered from their loue, and pitty, and good reſpect towards her, as being a grace fit for Gods people to ſhew to them which are in aduerſitie, wee learne: That <hi>good and godly people doe nothing leſſe eſteeme of the vertuous, for their outward low eſtate and pouerty.</hi> Theſe call her ſtill <hi>Naomi,</hi> and ſo acknowledge her; and <hi>Boaz</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed-vvell of her, euen in this poore eſtate: <hi>Ionathan</hi> did nothing leſſe eſteeme of <hi>Dauid,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was out of the Kings fauour: neither did <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of Arimathea leſſe reuerence or honor Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe he was condemned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted as a malefactour among theeues: for out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward croſtes, afflictions and miſeries of this life, are no ſtaine to true piety, when the croſſes fall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1830:61"/> vpon good men for righteouſneſſe ſake, or for the triall of their faith &amp; patience. Let vs not then, for outward aduerſitie, like the godly worſe, when wee haue loued them, or made ſhew of loue in their proſperity, but in aduerſitie ſhew greater tokens of loue; and doe not as <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, ſit downe and cenſure him; nor as Chriſts friends, and Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> which forſooke them in their troubles. An healthfull member of the body is beloued, but when it is in diſtreſſe, then loue of all the reſt of the members moſt ſheweth it ſelfe: and ſhould not our loue appeare to the godly in aduerſity, which be members with vs of the ſame body in Chriſt?</p>

                     <hi>And ſhee ſaid vnto them, Call mee not</hi> Naomi.] This name ſignifieth pleaſant and merry, which in her aduerſity ſhee thought did not befit her, and therefore ſhe did not reioyce in it. <hi>Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie maketh the afflicted nothing to regard worldly names and titles of a better condition and eſtate;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1830:61"/> while they be in miſerie,</hi> and haue loſt their former outward comforts, if they be wiſe and truely humbled; for ſuch as be humbled indeed, are not vainely in loue with goodly names and titles, to which their eſtate is not anſwerable. Which checketh the fooliſh pride of ſuch, as being in a baſe beggerly condition, liuing almoſt of almes, hanging vpon this and that friend, yet forſooth, will brag of their name, their houſe, and Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or rather indeed, to call it, as they make it, Gentiliſme, through their lewd and vaine conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Call me Marah.</hi>] That is, bitter, one in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and diſtreſſed eſtate. <hi>The truely humbled deſire to be accounted as they be, and not as they be not;</hi> as <hi>Naomi</hi> here is willing to be called <hi>Marah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her eſtate was anſwerable. Shee was not proud, ſhee ſubmitted her ſelfe to Gods hand, and therefore ſhee refuſed not a name according to the nature of her preſent condition. Whoſe humility may checke the pride of ſuch as would haue better names then they deſerue, ſeeking the name of <hi>Goodman,</hi> when goodneſſe is farre from them; of <hi>Maſter,</hi> when their Gentlemanſhip did hardly creepe out of a dunghill; of worſhipfull Eſquire, right worſhipfull, &amp; many ſuch vaine ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, which euery Vpſtart now in theſe dayes doe eagerly affect, not for any deſert of vertue, but for that they haue gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome money to put to vſurie, or procured ſome office baſely by their money, or a little better outward eſtate by illiberall and baſe ſcraping, pinching, and niggardly ſparing, or
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1830:62"/> by depending vpon ſome perſon in authority, by whoſe countenance they may domineere ouer their poore neighbours, or by ſome ſuch way and meanes, whereof this now preſent age affordeth inſtances enow; yet are ſuch farre enough off from the true cauſes of Gentrie, worſhip, and due honor. This good womans humility and patience, may alſo checke the pride and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of ſuch as cannot endure a name like their nature; they can be content to be Vſurers, but not ſo to be called; they can liue as Miſers, but will not ſo be accounted; the denomination from their ſinnefull practices is worſe to them, then the ſinnes which they doe commit; for that they more are touched with the ſhame of the euill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, then with the offence thereby commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt God. Here it may be demanded, Whether any may be called by any other name then formerly they haue beene called by? We ſee here that <hi>Naomi</hi> would be called <hi>Marah; Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was after called <hi>Iſrael; Abram, Abraham; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah Sarai;</hi> and many ſuch inſtances in Scripture; as <hi>Saul</hi> called after <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioſeph</hi> called <hi>Barſabas:</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>For the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.</hi>] The reaſon why ſhee would be called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> becauſe of her bitter affliction which the Lord Almighty hath laid vpon her. Whence we may learne theſe leſſons,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>the Lord is Almighty,</hi> Gen. 17. 1. for he can doe what he will in heauen and in earth, Pſa. 115. 3. This ſhould worke confidence in his Word, for what he ſaith, he will doe, he can doe, his power can effect it. This muſt make vs humble our ſelues vnder his mightie hand, 1. Pet. 5. 6. he is able to deſtroy and caſt into Hell, Mat. 10. 28. By this let vs be encouraged to doe what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth: for he can beare vs out in it, and can ſupply our wants, 2. Cor. 9. 7, 8. Hence may we gather comfort againſt all that riſe vp againſt vs
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1830:63"/> for the Lords cauſe: for he is greater then all, Iohn 10. 29. And we may, to conclude, learne to hope well of others, though they haue long gone aſtray: for God is able to ſaue them, Rom. 11. 23.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That <hi>the Almighty can alter an eſtate into the cleane contrarie;</hi> as <hi>Naomi</hi> into <hi>Marah,</hi> mirth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mourning, ſweet into ſowre, honor into diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; and contrarily, heauineſſe into ioy, diſgrace into high eſteeme, and ſo forth; as we may ſee in <hi>Iobs</hi> downefall, and alſo raiſing vp againe; in <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> honour, into extreme contempt; in <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2. 7, 8. Let none be proud in their proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, for God can caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe.

And as proſperity ſhould not make vs proud, becauſe God can caſt vs downe: ſo aduerſity ſhould not make vs deſpaire, becauſe God can raiſe vs vp, as he did <hi>Iob, Ioſeph,</hi> and <hi>Mordecai.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III.

                     <hi>I went out full.</hi>] Shee here ſpeaketh of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſtate, when ſhee went from among Gods people.

This good woman in this ſpeech giueth vs to know, that ſhee tooke notice of a fault in voluntarily leauing Gods people, to ſaue her goods, for which the Lord corrected her, yet in-mercy brought her home againe, though with loſſe. Note hence theſe things:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:1830:64"/>I. That <hi>it is a fault, voluntarily for ſafety of goods through diſtruſt, to leaue Gods people, and goe to liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Idolaters;</hi> for ſuch loue their bodies better then their ſoules, they expoſe themſelues to great dangers, and depriue themſelues of the publike and ordinary meanes of life and ſaluation. If ſuch haue warrant, as the woman had by <hi>Eliſha;</hi> they<note place="margin">2. King. 8. 1, 2.</note> may haue hope: but if they, voluntarily diſtruſting God, take ſuch a courſe, they may rather looke for a curſe, then expect a bleſſing.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That <hi>there is no certainty in worldly wealth:</hi> For here is mention of fulneſſe and emptineſſe in <hi>Naomi;</hi> and this may we ſee in the former exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Iob,</hi> of <hi>Haman:</hi> ſo in <hi>Salomon</hi> and his<note place="margin">Eſay 23. 9. Ezec. 27. 2, 27.</note> ſonne <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> in Babylon and Tyre; for the preſeruation of outward eſtates, is not in the hands of the poſſeſſours, nor within their power, but in God who is the Giuer: and againe, man in his abundance doth forget God, and ſo cauſeth the Lord to take it from them, as he did the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from <hi>Saul;</hi> the tenne Tribes from <hi>Salomons</hi> houſe, the gouernement from <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and the Empire from <hi>Belſhazzar.</hi> Wee are not then to ſet<note place="margin">Ier. 9. 23.</note> our hearts on our outward proſperity, Pſal. 62. 10. neither to glory in our riches: for outward glory is but as a fading flowre, and as the warme ſunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine in a cold winter day, ſoone gone, and all the delight thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That <hi>oftentimes the way and meanes which men take to preuent want, by the ſame they bring it vpon them,</hi> as it fell out here with <hi>Naomi,</hi> whoſe husband left Gods people, to goe into Moab, to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1830:65"/> ſaue their eſtate, and there loſt all, ſo as <hi>Naomi</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth home in very great want, who went out full. The like befell <hi>Lot</hi> in leauing <hi>Abraham</hi> for this worldly goods, and going to dwell in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where he left and loſt all, and was glad to eſcape with his life: for if the meanes we vſe be not good, it is farre from helping or preſeruing vs, as by Gods curſing thereof, it turneth to our ruine; for <hi>Ieroboam</hi> by his policie loſt his kingdome. Therefore in ſeeking to vphold, or to get an eſtate, looke to the meanes whether good or euill, leſt we come ſhort of that we doe looke for. It is ill to leaue the meanes of the ſoules ſafety, for theſe worldly commodities; after which we muſt<note place="margin">Prou. 21. 5. and 28. 22.</note> not make haſte, leſt we come to want; neither may we vſe vnlawfull courſes to get them: for the treaſures of wickedneſſe profit not, but ſhall<note place="margin">Pro. 21. 6, 7. &amp; 10. 2.</note> come to an ill end; as they are gotten, ſo in time commonly are they ſpent.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. That <hi>ſuch of Gods children as goe aſtray, he will bring home againe, but yet with correction,</hi> as he here doth <hi>Naomi;</hi> and as he did the Prodigall ſonne: which he doth in mercy, to make them to know their error, and to walke afterwards more warily. It is comfort that God will in mercy ſeeke vp his children, and not loſe one of them;<note place="margin">Luk. 15. 4. Iohn 17.</note> but yet feare to goe aſtray: for ſurely he will ſcourge them for their outroads, when he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them home, though it be a <hi>Dauid,</hi> a <hi>Iehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> or a <hi>Ioſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why then call ye me Naomi?</hi>] Hence learne, that <hi>the humbled and afflicted take no pleaſure to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1830:65"/> be remembred of their former proſperity by names and titles;</hi> for it but increaſeth ſorrow, and affordeth no comfort. What comfort might it be to tell <hi>Haman</hi> of his former honor, when he was going to hanging? What ioy to <hi>Herod</hi> to heare of his glory &amp; the applauding of him before, when now the iudgement was vpon him, and he eaten with wormes, for his vaine glory and pride? The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted are not hereby comforted, for <hi>Naomi</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no pleaſure in that name, whilſt ſhe is by her eſtate <hi>Marah.</hi> It is in vaine to mention to the heauie-hearted what they haue beene, except vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certaine hope of recouerie to the ſame againe; but their ſorrow muſt be eaſed by better meanes of comfort, by ſhewing them the cauſe, the end, and benefit of Gods Fatherly chaſtiſements, and ſo forth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seeing the Lord hath teſtified againſt mee.</hi>] Note hence:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>mans comfort is nothing able to allay the bitterneſſe of Gods diſcomforts vpon vs.</hi> Their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her <hi>Naomi</hi> could doe her no good, while ſhe knew her ſelfe called by the Lord, <hi>Marah,</hi> and whilſt hee did witneſſe againſt her. What can it profit a woman of place, whileſt ſhe is in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of her ſoule, and afflicted by ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous croſſe, to be called Lady, Madame, and to be ſpoken vnto with tearmes of honour, whileſt vnder Gods hand? This ſhould make the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt therefore take more delight in ſeeking to pleaſe God, and to enioy his fauour and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, than to be dignified with the moſt higheſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1830:66"/> titles: for theſe will afford no comfort, when God will not afford it.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That <hi>afflictions are commonly the Lords wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt vs, for ſome thing amiſſe in vs:</hi> for the firſt cauſe of them is ſinne, and the Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them for ſin, which the godly in affliction apply vnto themſelues. In affliction let vs ſearch out our waies and repent of our ſinnes, as did <hi>Dauid, Rehoboam,</hi> and as the Parable of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall ſonne teacheth, and the exhortations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance vpon the Lords afflicting of his people. We may not be like thoſe in <hi>Ezechiels</hi> daies, who murmured againſt the Lords hand vpon them, as not being the guilty parties, but that others had ſinned, and they vniuſtly puniſhed.<note place="margin">Ezech. 18. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Almighty hath afflicted me.</hi>] This ſheweth how God did witneſſe againſt her, euen by afflicting her. He witneſſeth againſt vs by his Word written, by his Meſſengers expounding and applying the Word, by our own conſciences accuſing, and by his corrections, and rod puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. By all which wai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es God ſpeaketh actually vnto vs, for our amendment; and the godly heare him ſpeake vnto them; they together with the correction, applying the Word vnto themſelues for their inſtruction, doe make the affliction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto them. The concluſion which hence I will note, is this: That <hi>the godly doe aſcribe all their afflictions to the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Naomi</hi> doth here, and as <hi>Iob</hi> did, Chap. 1. and 6. 4. and 30. 11. becauſe they know that nothing is by chance, but by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, Amos 3. 6. 2.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1830:66"/> Things fall not out by meere naturall cauſes, Iob 5. 6. but as the Lord will. And therefore ſhould we learne patience, ſeeing that afflictions come from God.

                     <hi>Iob,</hi> and in <hi>Dauid;</hi> and ſo it will in all ſuch as feare the Lord, and ſubmit themſelues to his good will and pleaſure, as our Sauiour did in the Garden, ſaying to his Father; <hi>Not as I will, but as thou</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In the beginning of barley harueſt.</hi>] This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the time and ſeaſon, doth argue the truth of the Story, for ſhewing the certainty of that, which <hi>Naomi</hi> had heard before, verſe 6. and alſo to be an introduction to that which followeth in the next chapter. This harueſt was in part of March, and part of Aprill: for ſo much ſooner is harueſt there than here. This harueſt time is that, which is the time promiſed to all the earth, Gen. 8. but yet not at one time to all. Now note here this vvith verſe. 6. and we may ſee that harueſt is called Gods viſiting his people with bread. Whence we learne, That <hi>harueſt is Gods bleſsing, in his mercy giuing bread to ſuſtaine mans life.</hi> This is his common bleſſing, Gen. 8. 22. and promiſed to the obedient with plenty, Leu. 26. 5, 10. for times and ſeaſons are in the Lords hand; and this time is the appointed time to reape and gather in the corne for food, by which man liueth. Therefore firſt, let vs acknowledge God, to be the Lord of<note place="margin">Mat. 9.</note> the harueſt, as hee calleth himſelfe, and confeſſe this bleſſing to be from him. Secondly, to pray to<note place="margin">Pſal. 147. 14. Pſal. 144. 13. Exo. 23. 16. and 34. 22. Deut. 16. 16, 17. Pro. 10. 5. &amp; 6 8.</note> him for it, ſeeing it is from him. Thirdly, to bee thankefull when wee enioy this bleſſing, and to pay the due allotted for the Lords ſeruice in te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of thankes. In old time none appeared before the Lord empty. Fourthly, to labour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly at this time, ſeeing it is the appointed time
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:1830:68"/> to gather in Gods bleſſings: and be not ſlothfull, the Ant will teach thee diligence. Fifthly, to take it as a puniſhment from God, when this har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt is taken from vs, which is done diuers waies, as by curſing the fruit that it proſper not, or by<note place="margin">Deut. 28. Ioel. 1. 11, 12. 2. Sam. 12. 17. Pro. 26. 1.</note> ſending vnſeaſonable weather to deſtroy the fruits. Laſtly, note hence, that it was in the very beginning of Barley harueſt, which was before their Wheate harueſt, for they had both wheate harueſt, as Gen. 30. 14. and 15. 1. and heere Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley harueſt, and this alſo firſt, as 2. Sam. 21. 9, 10. So that <hi>Naomi</hi> neglected no time, but tooke the very beginnning, as ſoone as euer ſhee heard of the Lords gracious viſitation and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her people. Thus can wee prouide for the body; let vs care alſo for the ſoule, that it want not the foode which endureth to eternall life. And thus much for this firſt chapter.</p>

                     <hi>Verſe 1.</hi> And <hi>Naomi</hi> had a kinſman of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> and his name was <hi>Boaz.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HEre is the party ſet out, whom God in his ſecret counſel had prouided for <hi>Ruth,</hi> who is deſcribed by his affinity with <hi>Naomi,</hi> &amp; how that was, then by his wealth, next, by his family, and laſtly, by his name; the drift is, to declare, what moued ſo great a man to ſhew ſuch kindneſſe to <hi>Ruth</hi> a ſtranger, and a poore woman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And</hi> Naomi <hi>had a kinſman of her husbands.] Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi</hi> was not baſely marryed, but to one of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſtocke, though now growne poore; yet this her affinity brought <hi>Boaz</hi> to haue a good reſpect vnto <hi>Ruth,</hi> euen for kindred ſake, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are theſe words ſet downe, as is before noted. Here obſerue,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>rich and poore may be nigh of kin. Naomi</hi> had a great wealthie man to her kinſman, by her husband, and that very nigh too, Chap. 3. 1. for diuerſity of outward eſtates doth not alter blood and kindred, though it make a change in their perſons. Let not therefore the rich diſdaine their poore kindred: for pouertie is no diſgrace where there is not want of honeſty: Chriſt was poore, and very poore, liuing of the almes of others. God chooſeth his people of ſuch, Iam. 2. None but haue poore kindred, and the beſt haue in ſome of their forefathers beene meane enough.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That <hi>euen kindred either is, or ſhould be of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1830:69"/> force to moue kinsfolke to reſpect one another.</hi> This is gathered hence, for that the ſcope of theſe words is to ſhew how <hi>Boaz</hi> came to reſpect <hi>Ruth,</hi> which was for Kindred ſake, yet chiefly for her vertues, as after ſhall be ſhewed; and for loue of kindred, ſee it in <hi>Rahab,</hi> Ioſh. 2. 13. and in the Sichemites, Iudg. 9. 3. though in other reſpects, in their choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> they were not to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. See this alſo in <hi>Samſons</hi> friends, Iudg. 16. in <hi>Cornelius</hi> to his friends, Act. 10. 24. For kindred are bone of bone, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſpake of Dauid,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 5. 1.</note> and are as the branches from one roote, and as members of one body, and therefore muſt loue one another; which reproueth this age, vvhich ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not for their kindred, except they bee rich, vvhich is the ſinne of vnnaturalneſſe, 2. Tim. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A mighty man of wealth.</hi>] Yet alſo a godly man, as appeareth by his godly behauior, his ſpeeches, his vvorkes of mercy, his praiſing vertue in others, and his obedience vnto Gods Lavv, in taking <hi>Ruth</hi> to vviſe. We ſee then, that <hi>a wealthy man may be a godly man ſometime.</hi> Such a vvealthy man vvas <hi>Abraham:</hi> ſo <hi>Iſaac, Iacob, Iob,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea: for goods and graces are not in themſelues oppoſite, being both the gifts of God; the one may helpe the other, grace to guide and diſpoſe vvell of goods, and goods vvell vſed, to declare and ſet forth the graces of the heart in almes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, in maintenance of Gods Word, and in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other Chriſtian duties: grace humbleth, vvhere riches vvould puffe vp, yet riches vvell v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bring grace in eſtimation before men, for they
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1830:69"/> inable men to ſhew forth godlineſſe, &amp; to paſſe on<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 20.</note> their time with the more comfort, and to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and defend their poore Chriſtian brethren in well-doing. Therefore if grace and goods goe together, thou haſt great cauſe to bleſſe God: for it is a moſt happy eſtate, to bee rich towards the world, and to God too, to bee rich body and ſoule: But although this is a very rare eſtate, yet wee ſee that they may meete together; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not thinke, that he which is rich, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be religious. True it is, that it is hard for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of heauen;<note place="margin">Luk. 18, 24. 25.</note> but it is not impoſſible. If any aske mee why ſo few are rich which be godly? I anſwer, Becauſe the Lord chooſeth moſt of ſuch as be poore, for his people; theſe make conſcience of getting goods, and will not follow the way of euill men and worldlings, to enrich themſelues, neither will the Lord make many of them rich, leſt they ſhould waxe in their wealth proud, and forgetfull of God, as men in their abundance do. Why, will ſome ſay, are moſt rich men hardly religious? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 26.</note> God chooſeth few of them, they be taken vp with the cares of this life, which choaketh the<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> ſeede of the Word in them; they ſet their hearts vpon their riches, as they ſee them encreaſe, and are wholy taken vp therewith, ſo as they cannot ſet their mindes on better things. Laſtly, they<note place="margin">Mark. 10. 17.</note> make riches their God, ſo as they cannot ſerue God, becauſe they ſerue Mammon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And of the family of Elimelech.</hi>] So as <hi>Boaz</hi> and hee were both of one houſe and ſtocke, and very
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1830:70"/> nobly borne both of them, Chap. 4. 20, 21. yet <hi>Elimelech</hi> poore, and his wife in a very meane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: ſo as wee hence may ſee, That <hi>parents may prouide for poſterity, but which of their children ſhall be rich, which poore, is of Gods diſpoſing, and not of mans forecaſt;</hi> as wee may ſee in theſe two, whoſe Anceſtor <hi>Nahſhon</hi> was the Prince of Iudah, the<note place="margin">Num. 1. 7, 16. &amp; 2. 3, 27. Eccleſ. 5. 14.</note> Royall Tribe, and ruled ouer 74000. men of war, or was fit for it. Thus parents may haue a goodly portion, when ſome of theirs may haue nothing left them. For riches are Gods gift, he can beſtow them, and he can take them away againe, which <hi>Iob</hi> acknowledged. If parents cannot make their children rich, then let them not with too much care vexe themſelues for them: let them not think that by their ſcraping together, they can make them wealthy after them; that is Gods bleſſing; that is his mercy; for if he bleſſe it not, Oh how ſoone is that conſumed by children, which pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents got with great labour and care, and perhaps with an ill conſcience too, which procured the curſe, beſides much infamy and hatred of men in their life time! Is it not madneſſe in parents to damne themſelues, in hope to make their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren great, ſeeing they cannot effect what they ſtriue for, except God bee ſo pleaſed to haue it? And then heere let children looke vp to God, and learne to feare him, and reſt not in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents gettings, but rather let them ſet themſelues to honeſt callings, and learne how to bee able ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and frugally to manage that which ſhall be giuen to them, that when they ſhall haue ſuch
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1830:70"/> goods and lands in their hands, which their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſhall leaue them, they may the better be able to employ them, and ſo preſerue vviſely that which is befallen vnto them: For let parents get what they can, if they leaue their children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out callings, idlely brought vp, to goe brauely, and to follow the looſe wayes of moſt rich mens children in theſe dayes, as not knowing any thing, but how to play the Gentlemen, as they call it; a conſumption will ſoone ſeaſe vpon all, and turne them out of all, and they become beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as dayly experience ſheweth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And his name was Boaz.</hi>] This is added for more certaine knowledge of the party her kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; circumſtances make Hiſtories more credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore are they expreſſed. This name ſignifieth [<hi>ſtrength or fortitude</hi>] whoſe ſonne he was, and of what houſe he came, is noted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the end of the fourth chapter.</p>

                     <hi>And Ruth the Moabiteſse ſaid vnto Naomi.</hi>] When <hi>Ruth</hi> was come into Iudah, ſhee and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi</hi> dwelt together, but yet in poore eſtate, and now time ſeruing to helpe themſelues by labour, <hi>Ruth</hi> bethinketh her ſelfe what to do in this caſe; ſhee murmureth not againſt the God of Iſrael, as his owne people the Iſraelites did in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and were ready to returne into Egypt; ſhee minded not Moab; ſhee was not offended with <hi>Naomi</hi> her pouertie, nor with the reſt for not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording her plenty; but ſhee reſolueth to vſe her owne labour for her helpe, while the time did ſerue. From which we may learne, That <hi>honeſt hearts truely intertaining Religion, doe not forſake it or the godly for worldly wants. Ruth</hi> could not for theſe things be made to ſtart backe; nor Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for all his afflictions; for ſincere hearts loue Religion for it ſelfe, and the godly for their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, not for their outward eſtate; they alſo doe know a reward of eternall happineſſe to be in the life to come, which they ſet before them, and therefore do not take offence from the outward things of this life, which they leaſt eſteeme of, and looke to haue the leaſt ſhare in them; which reproueth thoſe that for the wants of the world bid farewell to the Word, like <hi>Demaſſes:</hi> but the Apoſtles for Chriſt forſooke all; and <hi>Moſes</hi> choſe the poore eſtate of the godly to liue religiouſly,

Let children follow this example: <hi>Ruth</hi> was but a daughter in law, yet ſee her grace and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, which the Lord rewarded vnto her. Which iuſtly condemneth the ſawcineſſe of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in law in theſe dayes, who thinke no duety to be due to father or mother in law, eſpecially if they be poore, as was <hi>Naomi</hi> here. But what ſpeake I of children in law? I wiſh that a iuſt complaint might not be taken vp againſt ſuch as by nature owe themſelues vnto their parents. Are there not <hi>Dinah</hi>-like daughters, which will follow their delights till they returne home with ſhame? Doe not many marry as their luſt doth leade, without any reſpect to their parents, like the wanton ſonnes before the floud? I wiſh the<note place="margin">Gen. 6.</note> ſeed of <hi>Eſaus</hi> were not among vs, which vexe their parents. Children will ſeeke to be nouriſhed

Will they like a <hi>Ruth</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly labour for them? Or will they not rather deſpiſe them, and get from them, and labour for others? A ſtrange Maſters commandement ſhall be obeyed, when a word from poore parents will make ſtubborne children the more diſobedient: But let children know and remember the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſtubborne ſonne, Deut. 21. 18. and the curſe which is threatned againſt ſuch as deſpiſe<note place="margin">Deut. 27. 16.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And gleane eares of corne after him.] Ruth</hi> asketh not leaue to runne abroad to ſee others, or to be ſeene, to ſee the countrey, to get acquaintance, to goe to Wakes, Reuels, May-games, Morris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauncings, and ſuch heatheniſh vanities practiſed too commonly heere, but not knowne among the ancient people of God. No, no, <hi>Ruth</hi> deſireth to goe to labour for her liuing, and to helpe alſo her poore old mother in law, yea ſhee was not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to goe to gleane; though ſhee had beene the wife of one ſo well deſcended, ſhee ſcorneth not honeſt labour: For <hi>honeſt minds will ſtoupe to baſe meanes</hi> (in proud perſons conceits) <hi>ſo they be honeſt to relieue their wants in their poore eſtate. Moſes</hi> will not ſtand vpon his education, the gifts of his mind, and ſingular learning in all the wiſedome of the Egyptians, but will be content to keepe <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throes</hi> ſheep in his need; ſo will <hi>Paul</hi> worke with his hands, and make tents to maintaine himſelfe,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1830:72"/> though he was brought vp as a Scholler vnder learned <hi>Gamaliel.</hi> The humilitie of theſe is to be followed, as praiſe-worthy for their vertue and pietie herein. It is no ſhame to labour when men are brought low, whatſoeuer they be by birth, as they call it, and by their firſt education: The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neuer ſtood vpon theſe tearmes, as many now doe, who brag of their Gentrie, and yet are not aſhamed to goe a begging, or hang vpon their richer kindred, till they be weary of them, or will runne into diſhoneſt courſes, and all this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth becauſe they hold labour a diſgrace; worke they cannot, they will not; but it is no ſhame for them to liue diſhoneſtly, and idlely, contrary to nature, contrary to Gods iniunction, that men ſhould labour, contrary to the practice of all the godly, and the example of Chriſt himſelfe, who wrought in a handie-craft, as may be gathered by the words out of the Euangeliſt, and in that it<note place="margin">Mark. 6.</note> was ſaid, <hi>He went home &amp; was obedient vnto his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi> Note further how <hi>the truly-religious will not liue idly.</hi> This we may ſee in <hi>Ruth</hi> here, &amp; in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and others; for they make conſcience of the loſſe of time. Let him or they whoſoeuer, which thinke themſelues religious indeed, make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to take paines in ſome calling, and beware of liuing idlely. What if they can ſay, they haue outward meanes enough for themſelues to liue vpon? Yet they are not to liue idlely, becauſe idleneſſe is a great ſinne, the nurſe of all vice, as we ſee in thoſe that liue idlely, they are made the deuils inſtruments to all villanie; neither is it

And here let the poore honeſtly take this libertie to gleane, but firſt let them aske leaue of the owner, as <hi>Ruth</hi> did, verſe 7. then alſo to acknowledge it a fauour, as ſhee did. Thirdly, to gather the ſcattered eares, and not to cut off the eares of ſtanding corne, nor<note place="margin">Deut. 23. 24, 25.</note> to ſteale whole ſheaues, or out of ſhockes, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny theeuiſh people doe, to the hurt of their owne ſoules, and the hardening of mens hearts againſt themſelues, and other poore people more honeſt then they.</p>

Another place is in Luke 10. 4. where our Sauiour Chriſt forbiddeth his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to ſalute any man by the way. Neither is here forbidden to ſalute any: for in verſe 5. hee teacheth them to ſalute others. But this ſpeech was, to ſhew that they ſhould make ſpeede in that whereabout they were ſent, and to auoid the leaſt hinderance that might ſtay them from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their duty: for by ſaluting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſometimes occaſions are taken of ſtaying, which here he ſeemeth to haue relation vnto, and not that hee would haue them neglect common, and commendable courteſies. The third place is 2. Iohn verſe 10. where hee forbids to bid God ſpeede to ſome: which is to be vnderſtood, of not allowing of ſuch as were Heretickes and falſe teachers, as farre forth as they were ſuch, and therein not to wiſh them proſperity; which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ordinary ſalutations.</p>

                     <hi>Vnto his ſeruant that was ſet ouer the reapers.] Boaz</hi> had placed one as Ouerſeer to the reſt, &amp; of this man doth he demand the queſtion. Hence note, That <hi>it is a point of wiſedome in great families, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point an Ouerſeer ouer the reſt in the Maſters abſence.</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> had <hi>Eleazar</hi> his Steward; ſo had <hi>Ahab</hi> his <hi>Obadiah;</hi> and here <hi>Boaz</hi> the Bailiffe of his husbandrie: for Maſters cannot alway be with their ſeruants, and therefore it is neceſſary to haue ſuch a one, to ſet euery one to their taske, to ſee what is done, to be done with diligence, and alſo well and orderly, and to preuent falſehood and deceit, as well as they can, and further to acquaint their Maſter with his affaires, with the paines and labour of ſuch as be diligent, &amp; contrarily to giue notice of ſuch as be not for his ſeruice, that ſo the one ſort may be rewarded as they deſerue, and the other put off, after their wages be paid them; for the hyre muſt not be kept backe, which a good
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1830:79"/> Steward muſt haue care of for his Maſters credit, and his owne diſcharge. But yet here let maſters in ſetting one ouer the reſt, make a good choiſe, and ſee that the man be, Firſt, wiſe and skilfull in that he vndertaketh. Secondly, one diligent and painefull in his owne perſon. Thirdly, a man fearing God, as was <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeruant and <hi>Ahabs</hi> Steward: For ſuch a one will be honeſt towards his Maſter, carefull to make others reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and ſo procure a bleſſing to the whole houſe. Such an one may be truſted, as <hi>Potiphar</hi> did <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> and to ſuch an one authoritie may be committed to command others, and to order matters among ſeruants: but yet euer ſo, as that he be ready to giue an account of his ſtewardſhip. Now alſo hence we may inferre, that if one may be ſet ouer another in a familie, then alſo in a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth; for without order of ſuperiority<note place="margin">1. Chro. 27.</note> and inferiority, no Common-wealth can ſtand; which being true, ouerthroweth the Anabaptiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Anarchie. Moreouer, in that the Ouerſeer is asked concerning this damoſell by <hi>Boaz,</hi> and not the reſt, we learne, That <hi>ſeruants, who are betruſted with the care and charge of buſineſſe, are to giue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count touching any thing or perſon within their charge:</hi> to them the queſtion is to be made, which will make ſuch to looke to their charge, to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to anſwer according to the truſt committed into their hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whoſe damoſell is this?</hi>] This ſheweth that <hi>Ruth</hi> was yet but yong, and therefore the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to her, that came to be ſo famous for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1830:80"/> vertue: And in that <hi>Boaz</hi> asketh not what, but whoſe damoſel ſhee is; it giueth vs to know, that he thought her to belong to ſome, as one of the maids of Iſrael, and that ſhee was not (as now vaine yong women deſire to be) at their owne hand, which is the next way to lewdneſſe and all looſneſſe. Such Miſtriſleſſe maids were not then, as now too common, which maketh them alſo to become common. An euill not ſufferable in a well gouerned ſtate, to haue Maſterleſſe men or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſleſſe women. It is fit to aske young people till they be marryed, Whoſe they be? to whom they belong? and whom they doe ſerue? Before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this verſe, another thing may be noted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Boaz:</hi> That <hi>it is a wiſe part of a houſholder, to knowe who they be which come to his houſe, or into his grounds or field, to take commoditie by him:</hi> as he doth here, finding her in his field with his reapers; leſt a man giue countenance to the vnworthie:<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 3.</note> for men are to be mercifull, but yet in wiſedome, becauſe ſome are not to be relieued: Therefore let men well know to whom to giue. In former times amongſt vs, men haue beene commended for good houſekeepers: but if their houſekeeping were examined by Gods Word, we ſhould find it nothing leſſe then good houſekeeping, but rather ſuch houſes were houſes of riot, exceſſe, prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, gluttony, and drunkennes, ſuffering all ſorts of idle lewd, and licencious Mates to come in to eate, drinke, card, dice, ryot, and reuell vnder a Lord of miſrule, eſpecially at Chriſtmaſſe, a time pretended to be ſpent in ioy and reioycing in the

                  <p n="1">I.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. We may ſee, That <hi>the godly and well-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will praiſe vertue in whomſoeuer they ſee it,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſtrangers or home-borne, in poore or rich, noble or baſe perſons, friend or foe, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did in both <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Abner:</hi> becauſe honeſt and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous minds loue vertue truely in euery one; they are not tranſported with an ill-diſpoſed heart, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through pride or enuie, to diſdaine, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne graces in other, but to ſpeake the truth, and to praiſe them for whatſoeuer is good in them. This marke of true loue let vs ſhew forth: this will preſerue goodneſſe and vertue in others, procure reſpect to our ſelues, and good fauour to ſuch of them as be poore, as we may ſee here from <hi>Boaz</hi> towards <hi>Ruth.</hi> This condemneth ſuch Firſt, as cannot praiſe other for well-doing: which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1830:81"/> pride, or enuie, or malice, or all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and by which they ſhew too much ſelfe-loue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and little loue or none at all to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

                  <p n="3">III. We may obſerue, that in praiſes, Religion is to haue the firſt place: for here is <hi>Ruth</hi> ſet out, as one forſaking her heatheniſh acquaintance, to keepe company with a vertuous woman, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her idolatrous countrey, for to dwell in Iudah amongſt Gods people; and thus is <hi>Iob</hi> ſet<note place="margin">Iob 1.

Therefore here let our commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations begin, and not diſpraiſe men for profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion: an argument of the want of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: nor iudge them worthy commendations, which are altogether without Religion. True it is, that many may haue ſuch gifts of nature and art, as may much ſet them out with men: but if
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1830:82"/> they want Religion and vertue, their praiſe is more heatheniſh then Chriſtian: and therefore they haue no cauſe to reioyce in abilities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or art, ſeeing Satan the enemy of al mankind, may therein be preferred before them: and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can man be ſaid to be more excellent or happy then a very Deuill, except in the right vſe of true Religion: in nothing elſe can he goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond him, nay, in no other thing can he equall him. Let therefore true Religion and vndefiled before God the Father, which is, to viſit the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe and widdowes in their aduerſity, and to keepe our ſelues vnſpotted of the world, be our chiefeſt praiſe.</p>

Let the poore learne humility and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty; and not be inſolently bold and vnthankful, or falſe and deceitfull, as many be, who make no conſcience to filch and ſteale, and thinke their pouerty a reaſon ſufficient to excuſe them, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if it be but in trifling things as they account them, as is the picking now and then eares out of ſheaues, or ſhockes of corne; or breaking hedges for firewood; or robbing of Orchards; or the like.

                     <note place="margin">Ioſ. 7. 2. Sam. 18. 22.</note> vnto <hi>Ahimaaz.</hi> From this courteous ſpeech of <hi>Boaz</hi> both as an old man, and alſo indeed as a man of authoritie, as appeareth in verſe 1. and Chap. 4. 1. we learne,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. That <hi>an humble and mercifull man ſpeaketh kindly where he wiſheth well,</hi> as alſo <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did to his brethren; <hi>Ionathan</hi> to <hi>Dauid</hi> in diſtreſſe;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1830:85"/> and <hi>Iob</hi> to the poore. Humility is not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,<note place="margin">Iob 31. 18.</note> and mercy is compaſſionate, loue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee rough-hewed, and therefore ſuch as haue theſe graces, will be courteous, and cannot but vſe good tearmes, eſpecially to the poore and needie. Which condemneth thoſe as void of humility, mercy, and loue, which are like churliſh <hi>Nabals,</hi> and not like bleſſed <hi>Boaz</hi> vnto the honeſt and painefull poore.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. That <hi>the ancient in yeeres, and men in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are to behaue themſelues as Fathers vnto others;</hi> for ſo are they called, 1. Sam. 3. 6. Ioſ. 7. 19. 1. Sam. 24. 11. 2. King. 5. 12. and this muſt be in inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and good example; and the Magiſtrate in correcting, not with rigour, but as a father with mercy and compaſſion puniſhing the ſinne, but louing the perſon, as a father doth. It is a ſoule fault for the gray-headed to be more child-like, then father-like: and for a Magiſtrate to ſhew rather crueltie, then compaſſion. It were good for ſuch to remember, That they are as Fathers, That the world is vnſtable, That their turne may come to ſtand in need of mercy; and they ſhould think that God made the one as well as the other. This made <hi>Iob</hi> to carry himſelfe gently and<note place="margin">Iob 31. 15.</note> humbly towards his inferiours. And here let ſuch as be in authoritie, be reuerenced and loued as fathers, and beware that the ancient in yeeres be not deſpiſed, but rather doe them honour, Leuit. 19. 32. for old age is a Crowne of glory,<note place="margin">Prou. 16. 31.</note> when it is found in the way of righteouſneſſe. Let the children deuoured, which mocked the old
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1830:86"/> Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> be a warning to all ſuch to take heed, and remember <hi>Corah</hi> his rebellion againſt authority, and how the Lord puniſhed it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Goe not to gleane in another field, neither goe from hence; but abide here faſt by my maidens.</hi>] In harueſt all worke that can; men and women are here ſent into the field, &amp; continued working: It is the time of reaping and carrying in Gods bleſſings giuen, and therefore may none be idle. To come to the matter betweene <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> we ſee how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he in a louing tearme ſpake to her; here he expreſſeth his loue in deeds, both in theſe, and the words following in the next verſe. Note, That <hi>the goodneſſe of a mercifull good man ſtands not onely in louing tearmes, nor in faire words, without good deeds:</hi> both words and deeds are neceſſary to comfort the afflicted; with both which <hi>Boaz</hi> declareth his loue to <hi>Ruth:</hi> he alloweth her to gleane amongſt the ſheaues; he warneth her not to goe any whither elſe; he willeth her to keepe with his maidens, and to follow his Reapers, to eate victuals with them. Thus let men ſhew<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 18.</note> mercy in word and deed: we may not doe well, and ſpeake vncomfortably, neither may we giue good words, and neglect good deeds, as ſome in Saint <hi>Iames</hi> time did, and too many now doe.<note place="margin">Iam. 2.</note> Another thing may we hence note, That <hi>women are to keepe with women;</hi> this is <hi>Boaz</hi> aduice to her: and it is moſt fit for ſexe, for ſafety, for preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of chaſtitie, and a note of woman-like mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, from which ſuch be farre, as delight rather in mens company: a note of wantonneſſe, and of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1830:86"/> an vnchaſte heart. Women muſt company with women; and yet ſome not with any of that ſexe. <hi>Ruth</hi> muſt keepe with <hi>Boaz</hi> maidens, the ſeruants of a godly man. It is dangerous for a <hi>Dinah</hi> to goe to the daughters of the land; a chaſte maiden to goe amongſt wanton idolatrous women, or a vertuous woman amongſt vicious wantons, and vnchaſte perſons. Therefore let her, which loueth her honeſtie, walke wiſely towards both; auoid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the one, &amp; be wiſe to iudge of the other.</p>

See here how <hi>bountifull
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1830:87"/> a mercifull and louing man is: So is true loue in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it is,</hi> 1.

It is rare to heare of a Macedonian-like bounty, freely to giue beyond abilitie; or of any like a poore widow, which gaue her two mites, all ſhee had. If men would giue of their ſuperfluities, it were well.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Haue not I charged the yong men that they ſhould not touch thee?</hi>] To <hi>touch,</hi> is any way to wrong another, Gen. 26. 11. Pſal. 105. 15. Zach. 1. 8.

                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:1830:87"/> not ſo much as to touch them, as by way of offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereby iniurie. This care had <hi>Boaz</hi> for <hi>Ruth,</hi> who not only doth her good, but preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth euill from her, in laying his command vpon them not to touch her. And in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by an interrogation, it is not onely to aſſure her of the truth, but it implyeth his authoritie ouer them, ſo as they durſt not offer her any wrong, but would quietly ſuffer her to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. Whence note, I. <hi>Young poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ſtrangers euen then were ſubiect to abuſe;</hi> and young men too wantonly giuen towards ſuch. This <hi>Boaz</hi> knew, and therefore gaue them this charge: For youth is vanitie, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh, and luſt is as a commanding law ouer their hearts, except they haue grace to reſtraine the ſame, and that muſt bee by ordering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 9.</note> according to Gods Word.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1830:88"/> a fruit of loue, and alſo of faithfulneſſe, when any one hath taken another into his protection, and admitted among ſuch as he hath authoritie ouer. This is an vſe for Magiſtrates; they ſhould<note place="margin">Iob 29. 12, 17. Pſal. 82. 3, 4.

Mal. 3. 5.</note> poore Labourers; for wrong offered to theſe, greatly diſpleaſeth God, which hee threatneth to reuenge. And this ſhould teach Gouernours of families, ſo to rule and order their families, as they ſuffer not one to wrong another; that their eyes bee vpon them ſo, as they ſhould not dare to offend againſt honeſtie and chaſtitie, by ſitting among, and dallying with yong women, by filthie and wanton ſongs, by any other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements to ſinne, which young women are to auoid, as they haue a care to preſerue their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie; and young mens vanitie and wickedneſſe herein muſt be reſtrained by their Parents and Maſters: yet are there ſome ſo farre from this, as they can take pleaſure in the light behauiour and wanton ſpeeches of ſeruants and others, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in reaping their harueſt, allowing them thus, as they account it, to be merrie with their tongues, to make their hands to worke the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: but this is in compariſon a light fault, (though alſo a foule ſinne, Epheſ. 5.) for ſome Maſters are authors of vncleannes, and deflowre<note place="margin">Heb. 13.

                     <note place="margin">Iudg. 15.</note> for the countrie was hot, and the waters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the earth ſoone dried vp, the ſprings were hard to be found, and wells were very deepe; ſo as this was a very good fauour of <hi>Boaz</hi> to <hi>Ruth;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> we ſee in the next verſe, tooke it to be a great kindneſſe, and was very thankfull in all humilitie. By this we ſee, that <hi>a worke of mercy and loue may be ſhewed in a ſmall matter,</hi> as in a cup<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 42.</note> of cold water ſometime, which ſhal not loſe the reward: for it is mercie to ſupply the want of others for an heartie compaſſion, how little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the thing be. This may teach men to bee
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1830:89"/> thankfull for ſupply of their want, though the matter be but little, and not to thinke mercie and kindneſſe to conſiſt in great gifts, and good turnes to be done in things of weight onely.</p>

The Scripture often noteth the ciuill ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and comely behauiour of his Seruants, as worthy imitation, and as a iuſt reproofe to the rude and vnciuill. But yet here is a caueat firſt to them which vſe ſuch outward courteſies, that the ſame be done in humility of heart; that it be not a fooliſh affection, an apiſh imitation, or meere courtly complementing, being but all ſhadowes
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1830:89"/> of humility, and yet indeed nothing leſſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the liuely colours and publike En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of pride in ſuch perſons, if they be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued aright: Then next, that ſuch as haue theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent geſtures giuen them, doe conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they deſerue them, for their place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; if they doe not, receiue them not; if they doe, yet not to waxe proud in heart thereby.</p>
                  <p>It may bee, ſome will here make ſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as firſt, Whether it be lawfull to giue honour thus vnto man, in ſuch an adoring manner? This is anſwered before: for the holy Ghoſt recordeth it as commendable. Secondly, then what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene this which is done to men, and that which is done to God Almighty? Surely, in reſpect of the outward act, no difference is there at all, but of the minde, which doth conceiue of God herein as God, and ſo this outward humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becommeth diuine adoration; and of man, but as man, worthy of reuerence and honour for his place, his age and gifts, and ſo the worſhip and reuerence done him, is onely ciuill. Thirdly, ſome perhaps will aske, Whether this may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto wicked men? Yes without doubt, as we ſee <hi>Iacobs</hi> reuerence to profane <hi>Eſau; Dauids,</hi> to wicked <hi>Saul;</hi> and <hi>Abrahams</hi> bowing of himſelfe to the idolatrous Hittites: for men and their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to be diſtinguiſhed. True it is, that <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſhewed little reſpect vnto <hi>Iehoram;</hi> and <hi>Mordecai</hi> would doe no reuerence to proud <hi>Haman:</hi> but theſe had (no doubt) ſome extraordinary warrant ſo to doe, and are not therefore for ordinary imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1830:90"/> the reaſons alleaged for <hi>Mordecai</hi> are knowne, and therefore I will not trouble here the Reader with them, becauſe they bee but weake coniectures.</p>

                     <hi>Why haue I found grace in thine eyes, that thou ſhouldest take knowledge of me, ſeeing I am a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?</hi>] This humble ſoule wondreth at his ſo great kindneſſe, though it was but to haue leaue to gleane, and to drinke water out of the veſſels: She thought it ſtrange, that ſo great a perſonage ſhould ſpeake thus reſpectiuely to her that was but a ſtranger. From hence may we obſerue, firſt, that the vertuous and thankefull perſons take moſt kindly ſuch fauours as bee ſhewed them, and doe wonder rather thereat, then make light thereof, though but in common and meane things, eſpecially if the fauours bee done with cheerefulneſſe, as this vertuous woman <hi>Ruth</hi> doth here; for ſuch doe looke into themſelues, and their vnworthineſſe, thinking with themſelues what might rather withdraw mens affections from them, than win them to them. They alſo looke vp to God, and doe behold him in the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, ſhe being as Gods hand offering his mercies to them. Theſe things make them to bee very thankfull, and to expreſſe it fully. This example of thankfulneſſe is to be imitated of euery one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden vnto others, and iuſtly reproueth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull; of which there be theſe ſorts, Firſt, ſuch as receiue fauours, &amp; will not acknowledge them like the nine Lepers. Secondly, ſuch as ſcorneful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Luk. 17. 18.</note> refuſe kindneſſes offered, as they that will not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1830:90"/> be beholden vnto others, becauſe they thinke they can liue of themſelues. Thirdly, which will not requite a good turne done them, but rather churliſhly reproach the partie, as <hi>Nabal</hi> did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid.</hi> Fourthly, which will not helpe in need ſuch as put their very liues in their hands for them and for others; thus dealt the men of Sucoth with <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon.</hi> Fifthly, which in proſperity forget their friends, and what pleaſure was done them in their<note place="margin">Gen. 40. 23.</note> aduerſity; as did <hi>Pharaoes</hi> Cup-bearer. Sixtly,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9. 15.</note> which recompence euill for good; as <hi>Ioaſh</hi> did to <hi>Iehoiada</hi> his ſonne; <hi>Hanun</hi> to <hi>Dauids</hi> Meſſengers;<note place="margin">2.

Cor. 12. 15.</note> he loued them, the leſſe was he beloued. All theſe are ingratefull. Now, ingratitude is a foule ſinne, it is a ſtoppage to all fauours, and drieth vp the affection of mens hearts; and God puniſhed it in<note place="margin">2. Chro. 24. 25.

                     <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> and reuenged it vpon the Sechemites: and therefore let vs not be guiltie of a ſinne ſo hatefull to God and man. II. We learne, that <hi>it is a great fauour and grace for a rich Inhabitant, to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of one poore &amp; a ſtranger too.</hi> This <hi>Ruth</hi> in her words here confeſſeth and admireth. For indeed, nothing but goodneſſe in a man maketh him kind to ſtrangers, eſpecially poore ones: it is not nature, nor worldly reaſon. And therefore when ſtrangers find fauour where they come, let them acknowledge it a great kindneſſe, and a mercy of God, and a worke of his grace. III. That <hi>a godly man,</hi> as Boaz, <hi>will be good vnto the godly poore, though a ſtranger.</hi> And ſo ſhould wee; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

Oh how would they take on in our vncharitable dayes, if a poore <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi</hi> ſhould, after many yeeres, returne to the place of her former abode, and bring a poore woman with her, to charge the pariſh!

Theſe three, ſhamefaſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, humble geſture, and fewneſſe of words, doe grace a woman highly, and doe winne her honour, though neuer ſo poore. And therefore let women labour for them, more then for a faire face, gay clothes, and a great portion; theſe make them ſaleable with wantons and worldlings: but the other with the wiſe and vertuous.

Therefore muſt we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for theſe graces aboue all things, if wee would be maſters ouer our ſelues; if wee would preuaile againſt all hinderances of our ſaluation. Theſe will bridle luſts, contemne vaine honours, reſiſt Satan and his temptations: and ſeeing they are ſo powerfull, hence may we ſee whether wee haue this faith and true loue, if we can ouercome our corrupt nature, carnall reaſon, and this euill world: but if theſe ouermaſter vs, then want wee this faith and loue, from which thoſe be farre off, who are led like beaſts by nature, like ſenſuall men by luſts, corrupt reaſon, and by this vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant world, and the vanities thereof. Though they doe beare the name of Chriſtians, yet Chriſts power is farre from them. Note further hence, why hee ſpeaketh thus to <hi>Ruth:</hi> euen to giue her to know the true cauſe of his kindneſſe,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1830:94"/> and good reſpect towards her, euen her godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and grace; which may teach, That <hi>vertue and grace are the greateſt motiues to incite great men, which be alſo good men, vnto the workes of mercy and bounty to the poore:</hi> as we here ſee by <hi>Boaz</hi> ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; for vertue is louely to them which are vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, though the parties be neuer ſo poore. Let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore labour for grace and godlineſſe, that they may find mercy at the hands of the wealthy, for if they feare God, he wil be their ſpokes-man, hee will moue the hearts of others to doe them good. Though this bee the way to procure fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, yet commonly we ſee the poore idle, and too lewd of life; and yet they murmure, curſe, and rage, if they be not relieued: for they thinke they ought to be relieued, euen becauſe they bee poore, though neuer ſo wicked, though they will hardly labour to take any paines to liue, when of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, that they ſhould not be relieued. <hi>Hee that will not labour, let him not eate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 3.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle.

All which <hi>Ruth</hi> did: and theſe may the poore doe, which workes God will recompence; and all other dueties which one oweth to another, in any ſort, being done in faith, in loue, and in obedience to God, they are good workes, and the Lord will reward<note place="margin">Col. 3. 24.</note> the ſame; euen the honeſt and painefull ſeruice of a poore ſeruant, as the Apoſtle teacheth. Wee ſee then, that the pooreſt may doe good workes, though not ſuch, as commonly are ſo called, to the doing whereof the worlds wealth is required; and yet herein a poore ſoules two mites are more acceptable to God, then the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of the rich. II. <hi>The rich,</hi> from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Boaz, <hi>may not thinke ſcorne to pray, and that very heartily for the poore.</hi> It is a very rare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to ſee ſo mighty a man of wealth, and ſo high in authoritie, to be ſo much taken vp in his affection, in conſidering the poore womans ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as to breake forth into ſo vehement a prayer as this was, as appeareth by the doubling of the words: and yet this ought rich men to doe, if they thinke that the poore are not excluded out of the communion of Saints, and that they be
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1830:96"/> the children of God with them, as they are taught in the Lords Prayer. This would ſhew a great meaſure of grace, this would encourage much the poore to goe on in well-doing. But, alas, this comes not once into the thought of a rich man; he thinks the poore bound to pray for him, but himſelfe not at all, vpon any occaſion for them, becauſe he thinkes he can pleaſure them, but they can no way pleaſure him; ſo he conſidereth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outward and perſonall benefit, and not the excellencie of vertue, and fruit thereof to them and others, as <hi>Boaz</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>

Againe note, that there is to be expected a full reward for a good worke; I ſay, firſt a reward, yet ſo, that it be looked for in mercy, and not in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; for God hath promiſed a reward, and that in many places of Scripture; and then it ſhall be a full reward, which <hi>Boaz</hi> prayeth for here, to be giuen to <hi>Ruth:</hi> which ſhall be certainely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the life to come, &amp; here ſometime in a great meaſure, as it was to <hi>Ruth,</hi> in giuing her <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>az</hi> for an husband, which he little thought of in this prayer, that he ſhould be the reward of her godlineſſe and grace.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1830:103"/> if reaſon ſo require. Note againe here, what <hi>homely and plaine fare the godly in former times were contented to liue with</hi> vſually. See this in <hi>Abraham</hi> his intertainement, Bread, Butter, Milke and Veale; he runneth to fetch the Calfe himſelfe; <hi>Sarah</hi> bakes the Cakes, and the man dreſſeth the Calfe, for which the ſtrangers ſtay. Poore<note place="margin">2. King. 4. 38.</note> feeding had the Prophets; though <hi>Eliſha</hi> bade ſet on the great pot, it was but homely fare. They were not ſo dainty-toothed as now men be, which can eate nothing but what is finely cookt. The firſt ſweet tooth that in Scripture I doe reade of,<note place="margin">Gen. 27. 4.</note> was old <hi>Iſaac;</hi> hee loued ſauourie meate, which <hi>Eſau</hi> prouided for him; in whom hee tooke ſuch pleaſure for his veniſon and ſweet meates, that he would haue turned the bleſſing due to <hi>Iacob,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, which that prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> had formerly ſold for a meſſe of pottage, in the ſale of his birth-right. The godly ſhould not eate for the palate, and to pleaſe appetite, but to preſerue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is contented with a little, and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, though it want the daintie cooking. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie ſtomacks, and bodies well laboured, will not much care for ſawce; this daintineſſe ariſeth of idleneſſe, and too much plentie, which doe breed diſeaſes, and ſhorten life in many. Let theſe nice ſtomakes know, that <hi>Eſau;</hi> who no doubt fed daintily, that could prouide ſo well for his father; yet when he came once home hungrie, could bee glad of hunters fare, and ſup vp a meſſe a pottage: ſuch a delicate Cooke is Hunger, which can ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and make ſauourie very homely cheere. They
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1830:104"/> that deſpiſe plaine feeding, and loue to fare deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately euery day, muſt remember, that it was the<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 1.</note> practice of him that went to hell, he fared delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly euery day. This hardens the heart of ſuch, not to regard the poore, as it did his. This is chargeable, and bringeth vnto pouertie, and<note place="margin">Prou. 21. 16.</note> with-holdeth men from doing good works: for three things haue deſtroyed charitie among vs in rich men and Gentlemen, as they be called, to wit, coſtly buildings, coſtly rayment, and coſtly fare. Laſtly, this engendreth luſt, whence follow many enormities in them which follow idleneſſe, one of the ſinnes of Sodom. This moderate fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<note place="margin">Ezech. 16.</note> and homely wholeſome fare, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men were content to feed vpon, may reprooue the daintineſſe of ſeruants, which now adayes will hardly bee content with ſuch fare in their Maſters ſeruice, as when after comming to their owne hand, they would bee glad of the worſt bit thereof: but thus it is when men know not when they be well, neither vnderſtand what it is to bee maintained of others, till they come to find themſelues.</p>

                     <hi>And ſhe did eat, and was ſatisfied, and left.</hi>] As ſhe ſate downe to eate, being bidden, ſo ſhe did eate as much as did ſuffice, and left. Which ſheweth, firſt, her <hi>plentie,</hi> which <hi>is a bleſsing of God, to haue</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 11. 15. Leuit. 25. 5. Pſal. 37. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>enough to ſuffice nature;</hi> for ſo God promiſeth to his. Now, this bleſſing ſtands in three things; firſt, in health with a good ſtomake, that nature may receiue food for nouriſhment: ſecondly, in competencie of food, and wholeſome withall: thirdly, in Gods bleſsing of the ſame receiued, that it may ſtrengthen vs: none of theſe can bee wanting to the neceſſarie preſeruation of life: for ſtomake without food, food without health and ſtomake, and both without Gods bleſſing, are not able to ſaue life; where therefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, men haue cauſe to bleſſe God: ſo much for the plentie. In the next is ſhewed her moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſhee ate not to ſatietie, but what was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: for <hi>moderate feeders eate only to content nature;</hi> and that is ſufficient which refreſheth the body, and keepeth it apt for labour, and not that which ſatisfieth the vnruly appetite, but ouer-chargeth nature. This teacheth vs to eate what may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and be thankfull to God; two extremes are to be auoided: the one is ſuch abſtinence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſufficient food is not receiued to ſuſtaine life; either of a fooliſh deuotion, as ſome formerly haue done; or elſe of a deſperate neglect of life,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:1830:105"/> which is the murthering of a mans ſelfe. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is exceſſe, which is the ſinne of gluttony, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercharging nature, which ſinne is forbidden in Scripture: it breedeth ſecuritie in the heart, and<note place="margin">Luk. 21. 34. Rom. 13. 13. Phil. 3.</note> diſeaſes in the body, and ſo ſhortneth life. Such a one as is ſo giuen to this ſinne, is a belly-god; he is like the Horſe-leech, which ſucks till it can draw blood no longer, but is ready to burſt: He is like the Fiſh called Onos, or the Aſſe-fiſh, which hath the heart in the belly; ſo is this man ſet all on his panch. Hee is like the beaſt called Gulon, a name anſwerable to his nature, which<note place="margin">Geſner.</note> eateth that which hee preyeth vpon, if it bee a horſe, till all be deuoured, euer filling his belly, and then emptying it, and then falling to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, till all bee conſumed: ſuch a delight hath he in his appetite. And ſuch beaſt-like men there haue been, who hauing filled their belly, haue for the greedy deſire and vnſatiableneſſe of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, in variety of diſhes and delicacies, wiſhed their backe a belly. Such Gulons may from this beaſt behold themſelues, now like him they bee; but I may ſay, how worſe they bee; for he is a beaſt, and doth but like himſelfe; but theſe bee men hauing reaſon to guide, and ſhould haue Religion to bridle their deuouring nature, and brutiſh appetite. Laſtly, note that <hi>Ruth</hi> left of that which was giuen her, which ſhe alſo reſerued to giue vnto her Mother in law, as it followes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in verſ. 18.</p>

And there are ſuch reaſons to perſwade vs that <hi>Boaz</hi> would not neglect this duety, as we may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily admit his giuing of thankes. Firſt, his owne godlineſſe and knowledge of his duety; and then the commandement of God, Deut. 8. 10. which he could not be ignorant of, and of which no doubt he made conſcience. Therefore let not any from hence gather a looſe liberty to neglect this duety, becauſe the holy Writer mentioneth it not, but learne from other places to know it to be their<note place="margin">1.

                     <hi>And let fall alſo ſome of the handfuls of purpoſe for her.</hi>] As they reaped, they cut by handfuls, and thereof made ſheaues, of which handfuls they ſhould let ſome fall, as they were reaping, or elſe ſome of them, as they were binding vp the ſheaues, which is the more likely. Howſoeuer it was, we may note, I. That <hi>a mercifull man and a godly man is frank-hearted to the godly poore, ſuch as bee painefull and deſerue loue.</hi> This is euident in <hi>Boaz,</hi> whoſe mercifull kindneſſe is many wayes
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1830:108"/> ſet forth; hee ſpake to her in a louing appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, calling her, Daughter; he admitted her to his table, as one of his family; he praiſed her vertues, and prayed for her; he bound his ſeruants to the good behauiour towards her, to preuent iniurie which might be offered to her; and hee alſo did giue to her, and that both freely without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and largely without niggardly ſparing. Now a good man is mooued, as <hi>Boaz</hi> to this, becauſe hee conceiueth the miſerie of another with a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling; hee placeth himſelfe in their ſtead, and conſidereth his own frailtie, the worlds mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie, and that he may ſtand in need, if God ſhould lay his hand vpon him: laſtly, he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that God loueth a cheerefull giuer.

II. Note, <hi>that ſeruants are not to giue what is their Maſters, without his warrant:</hi> for <hi>Boaz</hi> here alloweth them to giue her; and without this warrant, it had not been lawfull for them to haue thus left her handfuls of corne: for ſeruants are but truſted with, or amongſt their Maſters goods; they are not diſpoſers of them; the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is at the pleaſure of the Owner, and not of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1830:109"/> the ſeruants, which haue no right in them at all. Thoſe ſeruants therefore which will take vpon them to giue of their Maſters goods, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of charity, or what elſe, are to be reproued: for it is theft ſo to doe, without the will of the<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 33.</note> Owner; and the gift ſo giuen, vnder what ſhew ſoeuer, is not acceptable to God: for men muſt giue of their owne, and not be liberal vpon other mens eſtates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And leaue them that ſhe may gleane them.</hi>] Here it may be asked, Why did not <hi>Boaz</hi> rather giue her a quantitie of corne, and ſo ſend her home, rather then to let her abide in the fields to gleane? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would ſo relieue her, as yet hee would keepe her in labour, and not maintaine her in idleneſſe. And this is <hi>the beſt charitie, ſo to relieue the poore, as we keepe them in labour.</hi> It benefits the giuer, to haue them labour; it benefits the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, to ſuffer no Droanes, nor to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh any in idleneſſe; and it benefits the poore themſelues, it keepes them in health, it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers them to bee idle or painefull; if paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it procureth them fauour: and laſtly, it keepeth them from idleneſſe, and ſo from a ſea of wickedneſſe, which the lazie perſons are ſubiect to, and run into, as the vagrant poore giueth vs ſufficiently to know, which dwell among vs, or rather rogue vp and downe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dwelling, or certaine abode. Let there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men thus relieue the poore with <hi>Boaz;</hi> and if men would ſpare from exceſſe of apparell, daintie fare, idle expences in keeping Hawkes
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1830:109"/> and Hounds, in following vnthriftie gaming, and ſuch like, and lay vp that to charitable vſes, to ſet the poore on worke, what ſingular good might be done! the poore would ceaſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, and the rich themſelues would be better for it.</p>

Before, hee warned them not to reproch her, by giuing her ill language; and here hee will not haue her to ſuffer rebuke at their hands, for taking what he ſhall allow her: for the <hi>ſeruant is not to find fault with any perſon, for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his Maſters kindneſſe:</hi> he may diſpoſe of his owne, and the ſeruant is not to diſlike with it, in checking the receiuer, in whom there is no cauſe of rebuke, but rather in the euill eye of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,<note place="margin">Matth. 02. 15.</note> as our Sauiour ſheweth in the parable of the Vineyard.</p>

                     <hi>And beate out that ſhee had gleaned.</hi>] Shee was both the Gleaner and the Threſher. Corne was beat out ſometime by oxen, or horſes treading, or by a wheele running vpon it, or by a ſtaffe, as here, or by the flaile, as now euery where with vs. It was a meane courſe to gleane, but a meaner for
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1830:111"/> her ſelfe to ſit downe to beate out what ſhee had gleaned; &amp; yet this ſhe did: before ſhe went home to her mother in law, whoſe houſe ſhee would not cumber, nor trouble her old head with the noyſe of the beating, ſhee would bring home all ready with her. Shee laboured more like a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant then a daughter in law, and yet ſhe in loue was more then a daughter in law; her ſeruice was beyond a ſeruant in labour and trauel, with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and faithfulneſſe, and her loue ſurpaſſed and exceeded the loue of many naturall children. The thing principally here to be noted is, that <hi>the godly, which indeed be truely humble, and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, refuſe no honest kind of labour. Abel</hi> will keepe ſheep; <hi>Iacob</hi> will doe the like; <hi>Sarah</hi> will bake cakes, euen ordinary bread, not like the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie ſtuffe, ſuch as our Ladies perhaps will put their hands vnto, if their fingers be yet not too fine; <hi>Rebecca</hi> will take a pitcher and fetch water, yea more, will draw for the Camels of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger out of courteſie; Yea, <hi>Gideon</hi> will thraſh; <hi>Boaz</hi> will lie by his corne heape; <hi>Ruth</hi> will beate out her corne; and the honorable woman will put her hand to the diſtaffe. The reaſons are, becauſe ſuch haue put on humilitie, which will refuſe to doe nothing that is honeſt and lawfull; they know no diſhoneſtie therein, and that it was held a vertue aforetimes to labour in ſuch things, as the pride of our times iudge baſe &amp; contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and themſelues diſgraced therein.

Who can hold that to be a diſgrace, which better me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue done? Better for pietie to God, better before men, for nobleneſſe of birth, for greatneſſe of ſtate, and for name of renowne in the world.

This conceit of diſgrace ariſeth from the ſpirit of pride and vanitie, in the ſonnes of <hi>Belial.</hi> But if conceit of diſgrace make them auoid labour in ſome calling, whether of the mind or body; then would I faine know, why they auoid not thoſe things wherein diſgrace is indeed? and why they ſhame not to liue idly, prodigally, laſciuiouſly,

Laſtly, theſe vnprofitable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers will ſay, they haue better beene brought vp, than to take paines. What is this better bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp? It is to follow faſhions, or to drinke and whiffe the Tabacco pipe, or to congie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, or to hunt and hawke, and then curſe and ſweare as the furies of Hell; or elſe to handle a weapon to ſtrike and ſtab, and vpon a word to challenge, and ſo into the field to play the Deuils companion, or to play at dice and cards, or to read amorous bookes, to court a Curtiſan, I ſhould ſay a Gentlewoman or a yong Gallant, to vanitie and wantonneſſe.

Other there be which will rob their Parents, and ſteale from them what they can get, yea, and thinke it no ſinne, as <hi>Salomon</hi> telleth<note place="margin">Prou. 28. 24.</note> vs; yet are they the companions of a deſtroyer.

                     <hi>That ſhee had reſerued, after ſhee was ſufficed.</hi>] It is meet to eate to ſuffice nature, for the preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life, and the better inabling of vs to walke painefully in our calling, of which before in verſe 14. Note farther hence, I. That <hi>ſuch as haue true loue, will ſpare from themſelues to relieue others,</hi> yea though they themſelues be but poore, and haue nothing but from hand to mouth, as we ſay. Of this we haue here an example, and in the poore<note place="margin">Luk. 21. 2.</note> widdow, which gaue her two mites; yea our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, who was relieued by others, yet kept a bag for the poore; he ſpared of his gifts, to giue vnto others. For true loue cannot but pittie the want of others: and ſuch as ſo loue, will not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1830:115"/> hoard vp for themſelues, and let their poore bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren remaine in want, when for the preſent they haue ſufficient; they liue in hope of ſupply, and doubt not of Gods prouidence for the time to come, when they giue charitably what they may ſpare for the preſent. This condemneth the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed couetouſneſſe of ſuch as haue laid vp in ſtore for many yeeres, and yet will not beſtow any thing vpon ſuch as doe need; and alſo it checketh ſuch as excuſe and exempt themſelues wholy and alwayes for giuing any thing, becauſe they be poore. If this plea had ſtucke in the heart of the poore widdow, which caſt her mites into the treaſurie, ſhee would haue reſerued them to her ſelfe: but ſo ſhould ſhee haue loſt her eternall praiſes. II. <hi>Such as would thriue, ſpend not all at once, but reſerue ſomewhat both for themſelues and for others. Ruth</hi> ate, ſhee was ſufficed, and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſome for afterwards, for her mother and her ſelfe: ſhe was not ryotous &amp; waſtfull, becauſe ſhe had more then did ſuffice for the preſent. For ſuch as be painfull, know how they come by that which they haue; they alſo know it to be a vertue to ſpare and keep, what neceſſitie cauſeth not to be layd out, neither charitie, nor pietie to be ſpent; they know, that what they haue, is ſo their owne before men, as yet before God they are but Stewards thereof. Therefore from this, and <hi>Ruths</hi> example, we muſt learne frugality, to vſe Gods bleſſings to doe our ſelues good; but we muſt beware of waſte, and not let any thing be loſt, as our Sauiour commanded, when he had fed ſo<note place="margin">Iohn 6. 12, 13.</note>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:1830:115"/> many thouſands. They then here are worthy of iuſt reprehenſion, who waſtfully conſume Gods bleſſings; ſome on their bellie, as doe Drunkards and Gluttons; ſome on their fleſhly delights, bringing themſelues to a morſell of bread; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vpon play and gaming, idle and prodigall vnthrifts, ſuch as this our nation now is too much burthened with; others vpon too coſtly and often fantaſticke attyre, the enſigne of pride and vanitie; to whom if any ſpeake for their reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they reply with words of contempt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and careleſſe neglect of their owne eſtate, ſaying, They ſpend but their own, what haue any to doe with it? But theſe muſt remember, that they muſt giue an account vnto God, whoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings they waſte; they muſt alſo know, that Gods gifts are not giuen them to conſume wholely vpon themſelues after their luſts, but to be Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thereof for God, and in his ſtead to doe good to others, as need ſhall require. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality the Lord often puniſheth with pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<note place="margin">Luk. 15.</note> and ſometime with impriſonment, yea with ſhamefull deaths in ſome, whom God giueth ouer to fall into the hand of the Magiſtrate for ſome euill committed and deſeruing death.</p>

And this teacheth ſuch as receiue fauours, to ſhew themſelues thankefull to them which beſtow them. Now thankefulneſſe appeareth, Firſt, in acknowledging of benefits receiued: the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is ingratitude, and a note of pride withall.

II. That <hi>it is the Lord that doth bleſse and make happy:</hi> for what is begged of God, that is acknowledged to be his gift. And what happineſſe corporall or ſpirituall can man attaine vnto, but by the Lord? Therefore if we want bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, let vs beg them of him, if wee haue them, acknowledge him the Authour, and be thankfull in cheerefull obedience for the ſame, as wee be exhorted in the Word of God: For who can<note place="margin">Deut. 10. 12.

Which may greatly comfort ſuch as be mercifull. And ſeeing the poore haue nothing elſe to repay backe, but their prayers; let them not faile in this, not onely when and while the benefit is in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but euen when for time the fauour may ſeeme to bee forgotten, ſo often as their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors come to their remembrance, not to faile to lift vp a thought to God for them.</p>

Let vs then, if we loue one truely, not bury our loue with him in his graue, as the manner of the world is now, which is full of counterfeit loue. But let vs imitate our heauenly Father, who loued <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and their ſeed after them, and promiſeth mercy vnto thouſands of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> of ſuch as loue him, and keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. This reproueth ſuch which let their loue die with their friends; alſo ſuch as loue their friends poſterity, if they be rich, but not if they be poore, as <hi>Boaz</hi> doth here: But true friendſhip maketh no difference of a friend by
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1830:120"/> riches and pouerty: for if this make the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the friendſhip is certainely counterfeit. Thirdly, this condemneth ſuch friends as loue ſuch as remaine of their friends departed ſo, as vnder colour of kindneſſe, they rob their children committed by the will of their dead friend to their cuſtodie; ſuch villanie there is in the world, and falſehood masked vnder the ſhadow of loue. Beſides inſtruction, here is alſo matter of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if we conſider how God raiſeth vp conſtant friends to poore poſterities; though this be rare, yet wee haue in this place an example, that God is the ſame in power and mercy to doe the like ſtill for his children: but be it that men faile to be faithfull in their loue, let vs be comforted in this, that the Lord is faithfull: if he loue <hi>Abraham</hi> his friend, his poſterity in Egypt after foure hundred yeeres ſhall reape benefit thereby; if the Lord choſe a <hi>Dauid,</hi> he will for a long time for his ſake ſhew kindneſſe to his poſterity. Let this, this I ſay, ſettle the hearts of carefull parents for their poſterity: for if the Lord loue them, hee will not faile them; nor forſake their poſterity that ſhall depend vpon him, hee is the ſure and conſtant friend, and will not leaue off his kindneſſe to the liuing and to the dead, as <hi>Naomi</hi> ſpeaketh heere of <hi>Boaz.</hi>

                     <hi>And Naomi ſaid vnto her, The man is neere of kin vnto vs, one of our next kinſmen.</hi>] It may ſeeme by this, that before now <hi>Naomi</hi> had not told <hi>Ruth</hi> of <hi>Boaz</hi> her rich kinſeman, but at this preſent, as occaſion had now offered it ſelfe, now ſhe telleth
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1830:121"/> her that hee was a very neere kinſman, one of her Redeemers, which had a right to redeeme the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and ſo to marry her, and to raiſe vp ſeed vnto the dead, as the Law required; and this<note place="margin">Deut. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Naomi</hi> telles her of, to ſhew how naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did in ſome ſort bind him to this kindneſſe which he had ſhewed her, and alſo to comfort <hi>Ruth</hi> in this poore eſtate, in hope of a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, as it afterwards fell out. Obſerue hence, I. That <hi>the godly wiſe poore are not vainglorious boaſters of their rich friends and kindred. Naomi</hi> made not him knowne before this to <hi>Ruth,</hi> both for that ſhee would not intice <hi>Ruth</hi> to come and embrace her company for any outward reſpect of worldly friendſhip, and alſo becauſe ſhee knew it to be folly to boaſt of rich friends, except they were ſure to find them good and kind. <hi>Naomi</hi> was not as ſome poore be, which fooliſhly brag of rich kinsfolke, while yet they find them not true friends, ſuch as will hardly acknowledge them to be of their kindred, either doe them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any good at all. II. That <hi>it is then a comfort to the poore to ſpeake of rich kindred, when they ſhew themſelues kind,</hi> as kindred ought to doe; for kindred may ſo be called from kindneſſe in them, and by ſhewing themſelues kind to their kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, as <hi>Boaz</hi> doth here; and therefore <hi>Naomi</hi> now, but not before, telleth <hi>Ruth</hi> of him, what he was to them. The poore may hence learne when fitly to ſpeake of ſuch kinsfolke: and the rich may ſee how to open the mouthes of their poore friends to ſpeake of them, and to pray for
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1830:121"/> them, euen by ſhewing the true tokens of loue and kindred. III. That <hi>neere kinsfolke are to be kind to their poore kindred:</hi> for <hi>Naomi</hi> giueth this as ſome reaſon of <hi>Boaz</hi> his ſo great fauour towards them: and this naturall bond of loue hath both reaſon and Religion to ſtrengthen the ſame: and therefore ſuch as bee ſo bound and will not be kind, doe againſt nature, reaſon, and Religion: as when parents neglect children; theſe, their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; ſo brethren and ſiſters one another: and yet this vnnaturall affection is common in theſe our dayes, which the Apoſtle condemneth, and alſo<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 31. 1. Tim. 3. 3.</note> foretelleth it to be a ſinne in the laſt dayes. Laſtly, in calling <hi>Boaz</hi> one of the Redeemers, as the word tranſlated <hi>kinſmen</hi> ſheweth, it may put vs in mind of this, that <hi>the Lord hath great care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the poore,</hi> who appointed by his Law the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption<note place="margin">Leuit. 25. 25.</note> of lands to the family againe, from<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 5. 6.</note> which it was fold. And this care hath euer the Lord had, as may appeare by commanding to relieue them, by promiſing to reward the good done vnto them, by bleſſing ſuch as haue beene mercifull, and leauing their praiſes in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by publiſhing their reward at the laſt day, and by ordaining a Law for the redemption of their eſtate among the Iſraelites. The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof may moue the poore to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and reſt in God; and the rich to bee good vnto the poore, and herein to imitate the Lord, who ſo careth for them, as we ſee.</p>

Where we ſee, that <hi>where praiſes of others are well taken, it maketh the Relater to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe more fully their goodneſſe.</hi> And therefore to incourage men to giue others their due praiſes, let vs receiue willingly the relation of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and graces. For ſuch is our corruption, that we can attend to ill reports, which makes many ſo ready to ſpeake ill of others. I wiſh our eares open in the other reſpect, but in this I would we were more dull of hearing. Three reaſons may be giuen of the relation of this kindneſſe to <hi>Naomi.</hi> One may be this, to ſet out <hi>Boaz</hi> praiſes, and to ſhew his kindneſſe to the full, euen as ſhe found it. If ſo, then we learne, that <hi>thankefull perſons conceale nothing of others kindneſses either in word or deed
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1830:122"/> that may tend to their iuſt commendations:</hi> and thus thankefull ſhould wee be. This thankfulneſſe is an excellent vertue commended in Scripture, and practiſed of the godly, as before is noted: and on the contrary, ingratitude is odious, and cauſeth vncharitableneſſe in giuing, becauſe the poore take not thankfully their almes; in len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alſo, &amp; that either not at all, for that men be ſo diſhoneſt, that they will not repay what they owe, or deferre to pay in due time, or not freely, but for gaine, becauſe men would benefit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by other mens money, but will not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requite it without compact aforehand. And thus we ſee the euill of ingratitude. The other reaſon may be, to know her mothers pleaſure therein, and how ſhee liked of it to goe ſtill into <hi>Boaz</hi> fields. If this, then we may learne, that <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are to take aduice of their parents in their courſes,</hi> ſo ſeruants of their maſters: for, this is to giue them honour; alſo an acknowledging themſelues to be at their diſpoſing, and not their owne men, and it will free them from blame, when things, perhaps, fall out croſſely. It is a fault for ſuch to runne on an head, as beſt pleaſeth themſelues: this is diſorder, and vnrulineſſe not ſufferable: this is headineſſe condemned by the Apoſtle, and much<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3. 4. Gen. 26. 35. &amp; 34. 1. and 21. 25, 26.</note> euill hath come hereby; ſee it in <hi>Eſau</hi> his marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; in <hi>Dinah</hi> her wandering; in <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> their cruelty; in <hi>Abimelechs</hi> contentious ſeruants, and <hi>Lots</hi> ſeruants; thoſe might haue bred heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burning betweene <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> as theſe diuided <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> aſunder: heady
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1830:123"/> and vnruly children and ſeruants may do a great deale of miſchiefe; they are therefore to be adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and to follow aduice. The third reaſon may be, to ſhew her mother in law, where ſhee might with good profit continue to gleane, and alſo of her willingneſſe therefore to continue in that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. If ſo, then we ſee that <hi>the fruit of our labour, gaine and commodity, doth ſpurre on the diligent to continue therein.</hi> Therefore pray for a bleſſing to be incouraged in paines-taking; and feeling the fruit, continue therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vntill they haue ended all my harueſt.</hi>] They had a barley and wheat harueſt, both here meant, as is plaine in verſe the 23.

What further may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from hence, ſee before in the eighth verſe, where the matter is handled; here onely is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of her liberty vnto her mother in law.

                  <p>THis is <hi>Naomi</hi> her reſolution to prouide a marriage for her daughter in law: it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with an interrogation, to ſhew her full determination. Here note who reſolueth, for whom, and what it is, and the end why.</p>

                     <hi>Then</hi> Naomi, <hi>her mother in law, ſaid vnto her, My daughter.</hi>] Here <hi>Naomi</hi> deuiſeth how to requite <hi>Ruth</hi> her loue and labour, which is by reſoluing to get a match for her; and this ſhe doth, as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth for her daughter, after that <hi>Ruth</hi> had ſo laboured, and now was at reſt with her in the houſe.

                     <hi>Shall I not ſeeke?</hi>] As if ſhe had ſaid; Know it, my daughter, that I am reſolued to ſeeke reſt for thee. <hi>It is the Parents dutie to prouide matches for</hi>

                     <hi>their children.</hi> So did God the generall Father, for his ſonne <hi>Adam, Abraham</hi> for <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> for <hi>Iacob;</hi> for children want iudgement to make their choiſe, and are led more by fond af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or by ſtrength of luſt, which is worſe, then by reaſon and good diſcretion: but yeeld they were wiſe in their choiſe, yet are they not ſo to doe it without conſent of Parents, but ſhould doe as <hi>Samſon</hi> did, who intreated his father and<note place="margin">Iudg. 14. 1, 2.</note> mother to get him for a wife, the maid which he liked. Let therefore Parents haue a care of this dutie, and betimes prouide for their children, as they ſhall ſee iuſt cauſe, and ſo make choiſe, as one may be a mutuall helpe to another; for this end let them obſerue their natures, like ſomewhat in yeeres, in conditions, and body in ſome ſort, that one may bee pleaſed with the other: then know their religion and vertues, that they may bee of one heart towards God; ſo ſhall they loue one another much better, pray for one another, and haue a fellow-feeling in euery condition; yea, this will ſweeten their eſtate vnto them. When they haue noted well theſe two, if with good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and graces they can procure goods, it ſhall not bee amiſſe to helpe to beare the burthen of marriage. Such Parents are here to bee reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, which neglect this dutie, either of careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1830:127"/> wanting true loue; or of wicked couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for that they are not willing to ſpare any thing from themſelues, though yet they haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>

                        </gap>entutis,</hi> becauſe youth are toſſed by luſtfull thoughts, as the ſhip with the waues of the Sea, till they be married. <hi>Mulieri</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>nulla est requies, donec nupſerit;</hi> It may alſo be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led reſt, for the contentment and delight which one ought to haue in the other, and in the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of poſteritie, by the mercy of God. Seeing it is ſo called, let the married parties labor to make it an eſtate of reſt and peace: and the meanes bee theſe: Firſt, to loue one another intirely: to worke this, ſee the good things in one another, and couer the euill, and winke at defects, and bee as blind that way after marriage, as they bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Secondly, to performe duties of loue one to another chearefully: ſo they haue promiſed, ſo God commands them, and ſo the mutuall good of both requireth it, and true loue will doe it. Thirdly, to beare one anothers infirmities pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, for they bee one; elſe this will make them two, if they cannot beare with one another, and forbeare too, to keepe peace. Fourthly, to take their outward eſtate of God thankfully, and liue
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1830:128"/> in this reſpect contentedly; let them not thinke how better they might haue bin; for ſuch diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented thoughts breed but ſorrowes, and help no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to quietneſſe, but rather to encreaſe diſcord. Fifthly, to pray daily one for another, and that feruently, that God would remoue the hinderances of loue, or giue wiſdome &amp; patience to beare the ſame. Sixthly, and laſtly, in euery diſcontentment to lay the fault rather vpon our ſelfe, then to caſt it vpon the other; let the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band thinke rather the cauſe to bee in himſelfe, then in his wife; ſo the wife is rather to blame her ſelfe, then her husband. If thus the married would doe, faults would be ſoone amended, and iarres preuented: and the failing in theſe things, is the cauſe that marriage is not the eſtate of reſt, but a miſerable reſtleſſe condition, and that through their owne ſinnes and corruptions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it may be well with thee.] Marriage is for the well-being of ſuch as enter into that holy: eſtate.</hi> The husband is for a guide to the woman, and the woman is ordained for a meet helpe for the<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> man. And therefore this is for confutation of thoſe, which ſimply preferre ſingle life before marriage; nay, doth not God ſay, <hi>It is not good for man to be alone?</hi> Marriage is called an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate, and is commended farre before the other life in Scripture. It maketh two one, it is the holy meanes of a lawfull poſteritie, and it is the eſtate in which the moſt holieſt haue liued, and in which Chriſt himſelfe would bee borne, though conceiued by the holy Ghoſt, and borne
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1830:128"/> of his Mother a Virgin. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth ſingle life; but not ſimply, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto the then preſent times, full of troubles and perſecutions. If Marriage bee then for well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being, let Parents take care to prouide for their children matches, fit and commodious for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for conditions and meanes of maintenance, for ſo ſhall it be well with them. And let ſuch as be married, ſo make a right vſe of marriage, that it may be for their well-being, and the bettring of themſelues; which ſtands in three things: Firſt, in the mutuall ſocietie and neere fellowſhip of one another; for two are better then one. Secondly, in preuenting thereby incontinencie, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full luſts of the fleſh. Thirdly, in begetting an holy poſteritie, training them vp in the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and information of the Lord, in whom their Parents doe liue, after they be dead.</p>

Where we then wiſh well, let vs ſhew it, in counſell, in helpe, in countenance, and not be as ſuch, which will not aduiſe their friends of their owne accord, nor helpe them in aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hardly countenance them, when any of note frowne vpon them.

                     <hi>And now is not</hi> Boaz <hi>of our kindred?</hi>] How a kin to them, ſee chap. 1. 1. and 2. 1. This kindred ſhe nameth, becauſe of the Law in Deut. 25. 5, 6. of which afterwards in chap. 4. Here wee doe ſee what ground ſhe had to ſeek this match for <hi>Ruth,</hi> euen the Law of God, as ſhee thought. Her ground in thus making choiſe was from God, and therefore there was more hope to ſpeed, though in mans reaſon moſt vnlikely. Note, that <hi>Godly Parents ſeeke to match their children where God alloweth. Abraham</hi> will not match with the<note place="margin">Gen. 24.</note> Canaanites, but ſends into his owne countrie, and thither <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca</hi> ſend <hi>Iacob;</hi> for as in other things, ſo in this they ſet God before them, looking to his liking and approbation, that they may expect his bleſſing. Therefore let ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1830:129"/> to marry, marrie in the Lord, haue his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. 36.</note> and pray for his preſence at the marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, at which he will be, if it be after his will; that is, when parties marry lawfully, and in the feare of his Name. Other marriages he will not countenance, as theſe; firſt, ſuch as bee made within degrees forbidden, though allowed by the vſurped authoritie of the Popes forged Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carſhip. Secondly, with Infidels, as did the Iewes,<note place="margin">Neh. 13. 25, 26. 1. King. 11. 1.</note> and into which ſinne fell <hi>Salomon.</hi> Thirdly, with Idolaters, though they profeſſe the true God, and yet worſhip Idols, as did <hi>Achab;</hi> and therefore <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> his marrying of <hi>Iehoram</hi> his ſonne with <hi>Athaliah,</hi> was vnlawfull, and puniſhed heauily by God: ſuch is the marriage of a Proteſtant with a Papiſt. Fourthly, with wretched worldlings, and<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5. 10, 11.</note> ſuch as be without Religion in truth and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for if we haue not ordinary familiaritie with the wicked, with ſuch as bee fornicators, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,<note place="margin">1.

Fifthly, with ſuch as bee vniuſtly diuorced: for that is to marry another mans wife, and to commit adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Theſe marriages are made after the fleſh,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1830:130"/> where the diuell danceth, but God is diſpleaſed, and good Angels, and good men offended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>With whoſe maidens thou waſt.</hi>] Theſe words are added, to ſhew what <hi>Boaz</hi> ſhe meant, and alſo to giue <hi>Ruth</hi> ſome hope of good ſucceſſe. For <hi>Ruth</hi> might obiect three things, which <hi>Naomi</hi> in this verſe preuenteth. She might haue ſaid: Alas, I am poore, what hope of one ſo rich? To which <hi>Naomi</hi> anſwereth, He is thy Kinſman, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by law bound to marry with thee; though herein ſhe did ſomewhat erre. Againe, if <hi>Ruth</hi> had ſaid, I am not knowne well to him, and I feare his diſlike: <hi>Naomi</hi> here putteth her in mind with whom ſhee had been, euen with <hi>Boaz,</hi> who had taken notice of her, and had been kind to her, and had ſpoken well of her; yea, in this ſhe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth a particular kindneſſe of <hi>Boaz</hi> to her remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, who willed her to abide with his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. Thirdly, if <hi>Ruth</hi> had obiected the want of opportunitie and fit occaſion to ſpeake to him; <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>Naomi) hee winnoweth this night bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in the threſhing-floore.</hi> So then note, <hi>That war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from God, experience of the loue of man, and fit occaſion to effect a matter, are ſtrong inducements to attempt the ſame.</hi> Theſe made <hi>Eſter</hi> to aduenture to goe vnto <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> her calling from God, her experience of former fauour, and the preſent cauſe requiring, and occaſion offered to make triall. And where theſe concurre, let vs boldly doe our indeuour, with hope to effect what wee goe about.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And put thy raiment vpon thee;</hi>] That is, thy beſt apparell, or ſuch as thou haſt put vpon thee handſomely. Concerning apparell I will ſpeake ſomewhat at large. In innocencie there was no need of rayment: <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> in that eſtate liued naked, and were not aſhamed, neither was there cauſe, for that they had not ſinned; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall, it was of neceſſity to put on apparell, to couer our nakedneſſe, for preſeruation of our bodies, and to defend them from extreme cold, heate, and from hurts which they are ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in going naked. So then, now we ſhould haue care for rayment, for our ſelues, for ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend<note place="margin">Prou. 31. 21.</note> vpon vs, and for the poore, as <hi>Iob</hi> had.<note place="margin">Iob 31. 19.</note> Touching this neceſſity of wearing apparell, it is agreed vpon on all hands, nature teacheth it, and need inforceth it, and herein to haue not onely one ſute, but change alſo for ſhift, if we be able; for it is lawfull to haue change of rayment, yea to
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:1830:134"/> weare coſtly apparell, ſo it be comely. Of which I will ſpeake in order. We may haue change of rayment, there is a neceſſity in it, a cleanlineſſe alſo, and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in loue gaue to <hi>Beniamin</hi> fiue<note place="margin">Gen. 45. 22.</note> changes of rayment, for him to weare. If any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 10.</note> our Sauiour his forbidding two coats: We muſt know, it was no abſolute forbidding: for there he alſo forbids prouiding of money for their iourney, and other things elſe. But this was to ſhew, that they were to make ſpeed, and alſo to teach them to depend vpon his prouidence; for he vndertooke to prouide for them in this iourney. And by this experience of Chriſts mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards them, he would teach them how to truſt in God, when hee was to ſend them abroad into all the world after his Aſcenſion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the begging Fryers haue hence no ground for their idle life, and for their hauing but one coate. True it is, that to haue changes of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſee our brother naked, hauing no cloathes to put on, and yet we not ſupply his want, were an vnmercifulneſſe, if ſo by our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of him, he ſhould periſh: otherwiſe we may weare change of rayment, yea &amp; put on coſtly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, with changeable colours, &amp; ornaments vpon. <hi>Salomon</hi> wore coſtly attyre: ſo his wife, <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>

And as for ornaments, as eareings, bracelets, chaines, rings, Iewels of gold and ſiluer, the Lord allowed

But here wee muſt obſerue decencie, which is a comelines befitting the perſon of euery one. And here muſt be conſidered firſt, age, young or old: for the ſame color &amp; faſhion befit not both alike. Secondly, the ſex, man and woman; for theſe muſt be diſtinguiſhed, as God ordained in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law: nature it ſelfe, reaſon, and lawes of well gouerned Common-weales doe ſo ordaine alſo. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vide Kick. de politeta, lib. 1. cap. 10.</note> the profeſſion and calling of perſons, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in place; for ſome be publike, ſome bee priuate, which muſt bee looked vnto. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reproueable for publike perſons out of baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not to goe as their place requireth; and for priuate perſons to goe beyond their calling, and their condition of life, although it bee not aboue their habilitie; for this breedeth confuſion and diſcord: when ſuch alſo as by profeſſion ſhould be graue, as Scholers, and Miniſters, yet doe goe Ruffian like, it is worthy of reproofe, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo. Fourthly, the manner of wearing muſt be obſerued; it muſt bee comely, with ſhamefaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 9.</note> and modeſtie, both in men and women; we muſt ſo weare our apparell, as grace and vertue, and not corruption of heart and vice ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to bee in vs. The vertues which muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in vs by our attire, are theſe: Firſt, is <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie;</hi> for raiment was to couer our ſhame, and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1830:135"/> therefore that whoriſh faſhion of going with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked breſts, and ſo low vncouered, as ſome doe, is to be abhorred of modeſt women, and chaſte vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. <hi>Sulpitius Gallus,</hi> a Heathen Romane, fell out with his wife, becauſe ſhee went abroad with her face vncouered, and ſaid to her, The law limits my ſight vnto thee, to which thou art to approue thy beauty, and to become faire and louely: but to bee willing to bee ſeene beautifull to others, muſt needs bring ſuſpition of an ill mind, and a ſtaine withall. I wiſh husbands to bee <hi>Sulpitius</hi>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to ſuch wiues as goe thus wantonly bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breſted, ſhewing how naked their hearts be vnto luſtfull practices. But ſome fooliſh and harlotrie husbands doe delight to ſee their wiues and daughters to goe ſo; they be like <hi>Aſsuerus,</hi> who will haue <hi>Vaſhti</hi> to come forth to ſhew her ſelfe; but I wiſh the wiues in this thing like <hi>Vaſhti,</hi> and not to yeeld to their drunken humoured huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to goe ſo immodeſtly: but they are, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, rewarded as they iuſtly deſerue ſometime: for can the ſhop-windows alway ſtand open, and no cuſtomers come at any time to buy? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is <hi>grauitie</hi> according to yeeres, and therefore all fantaſtick, light, vaine and daily ſtrange faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, now in one, then in another, is folly and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, apiſh toying, and argueth great leuitie of<note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 8.</note> mind, condemned by the Word, and by all ſober and graue perſons. Thirdly, is <hi>frugalitie,</hi> for exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue coſt is vnthriftineſſe, and herein a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to a mans eſtate, and an argument of idleneſſe, if men commonly goe coſtly. The rich
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1830:136"/> Glutton is taxed for going coſtly, and fairing<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> daintily euery day, which brought him to hell at laſt. Fourthly, is <hi>humilitie:</hi> for indeed our ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the firſt cauſe, is a ſigne of our rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt God, and that wee haue loſt our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; and therefore we haue no more cauſe to be proud thereof, then a malefactor, of his halter, though it be golden. It is reproued as a fault in the daughters of <hi>Iudah,</hi> to be ſo proud of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire:<note place="margin">Iſai. 3.</note> and we haue more reaſon to weepe, then to wax high-minded by this couering of our ſhame and nakedneſſe. I wiſh wee were like one <hi>Pambo</hi> a godly man being at Alexandria, and there ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Pet. de Nata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lib.

Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is <hi>Pietie:</hi> when in time of humiliation and dayes of abſtinence, we goe as ſuch ſhould, who feele the hand of God, and apprehend his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt ſinne; and when we ſo aray our ſelues daily, as that modeſty, grauity, frugality, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie may appeare therein; for why ſhould we not euen in our clothing ſet forth our profeſſion, and thereby grace our Religion? And this piety ſhall appeare, if when we garniſh the body, wee neglect not to beautifie the ſoule with learning and Religion; for a man in rich clothes, without other better qualities and endowments of mind,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1830:136"/> is, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſaid, a ſheepe in a golden fleece; and yet ſuch ſheepe haue wee in our Engliſh pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, for want of grace, and better education, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing to ſet them out withall, but the brauerie of their clothing, which <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> called, The Enſigne of pride, and the neſt of luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;<note place="margin">Vexillum ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biae, &amp; nidu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And thus much for this point.</p>

Secondly, his ignorance, not knowing what it was, becauſe ſhe came in vnknowne to him, when he was aſleepe: and in ſuch caſes we be more apt to conceit euill towards vs, men good, becauſe our hearts tell vs, that wee bee wicked by nature, and deſerue euill. Thirdly, the darke and dead time of the night, which is to man fearefull: the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh<note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 5.</note> of the terror of the night.

Fourthly, this feare may more ſuddenly poſſeſſe one in the night, as here it did <hi>Boaz</hi> being alone: for that Spirits haue taken at ſuch times bodily ſhapes vpon them, and ſhewed themſelues: for the night is their time chiefly, as may be ſeene in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming then moſt commonly to Witches, knowne
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1830:143"/> by their owne confeſſion. Let vs therefore hence take notice of this weakeneſſe, which ſo ſheweth it ſelfe from the loue we beare to our bodies ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and naturall life. Now, if wee feare ſo much for this cauſe bodily dangers, Oh how much more ſhould we feare to commit ſinne, and the wrath of God for ſinne, which bring deſtruction to body and ſoule, without timely repentance!</p>

This naturall feare is more quicke and ſudden to ſeaze vpon the heart, then the ſpirituall feare to auoide ſinne, or the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, and ſo the danger of the ruine of our ſoules: for this danger is not ſo ſoone appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; here is required the grace of illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of faith, before this can bee wrought in vs.</p>

And therefore let husbands ſhew themſelues to be ſuch: &amp; this ſhal they do, if they doe giue their wiues countenance, and do grace them with all their credit; if they vpon all iuſt occaſions ſtand for them, defend their perſons, honeſtie and credit againſt others; if they loue, cheriſh, and nouriſh them, as their owne bodies, affoording them all honeſt contentment, then are they good protectors.

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:1830:149"/> cankred malice, and ſhew more ill will at the laſt, then loue at the firſt; like <hi>Amon</hi> to his ſiſter <hi>Tamar,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Dauid:</hi> for that loue was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor ſound in them, as <hi>Ionathans</hi> was to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Ruths</hi> to <hi>Naomi,</hi> and hers to <hi>Ruth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In as much as thou followest not young men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poore or rich.] Boaz</hi> in the other words gaue a reaſon of his bleſſing of her; here he giueth a reaſon of his ſo commending her kindneſſe: which appeareth to bee more at the laſt now, than at the firſt, to wit, to her husband deceaſed, and to her now mother in law <hi>Naomi,</hi> becauſe ſhee married him in her owne countrey, and him rather then any of her owne nation, which was kindneſſe; then, for <hi>Naomi</hi> her ſake to leaue her owne countrey, and to come and dwell with her in Iudah in a poore eſtate; this was great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but now to be ruled by <hi>Naomi,</hi> beeing ſo yong a woman, to ſeeke to match with an old man, and not to follow nature, in deſiring yong men; but the Law of God, for to raiſe vp a name againe vnto her dead husband, whom by this meanes ſhee maketh to liue againe in Iſrael; this is it which maketh her kindneſſe to bee more at laſt then at the firſt, in louing an old man rather than any yong, and him alſo for the dead ſake, to reuiue his name among the people of God. See here in <hi>Ruth,</hi> how <hi>true loue, obedience to good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and grace, doe ouercome nature, and the law of luſt:</hi> for ſhee loued her husband, ſhee was obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to <hi>Naomi,</hi> and in her ſelfe vertuous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1830:149"/> reaſon and Religion did take place, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, nor luſt preuailed with her. A good example for youth to follow. Note out of theſe words farther theſe leſſons: Firſt, that <hi>as now, ſo then, and euer before, there haue beene two ſorts, rich and poore in the world.</hi> Firſt, to ſhew in one, what all might haue beene; and in the other the poore, what all deſerue to bee. Secondly, that the rich may haue occaſion to ſhew workes of mercy, and the poore labouring painefully and honeſtly, may haue to whom to goe vnto for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: for the rich are Gods Stewards for the poore. Let both ſeeke to liue together louingly, and to helpe one another; the poore, to lend their labour to the rich, and the rich to ſupply their wants; for the one cannot liue without the other: all cannot bee rich, neither muſt all bee poore. Let vs reſt contented with our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; let not the poore murmur with enuy at the rich; neither let theſe deſpiſe the poore: for God hath made them both, and one to ſtand in need of the other. Secondly, that <hi>yong perſons in nature affect to marry with yong perſons like themſelues;</hi> which is implyed by <hi>Boaz</hi> ſpeech. So did <hi>Iſaac</hi> marry, and <hi>Iacob;</hi> and ſo in ancient time were matches made. If euer old and young marryed together, it was the old man with a young woman, but neuer an old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with a young man, as the wanton and lecherous often doe with wanton young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in theſe dayes, to the ſtaine of their ſexe, and reproach to themſelues and often their vtter
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1830:150"/> vndoing. For youth cannot affect old age, and therefore it is fitteſt that marriage bee made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene ſuch as may moſt likely agree together; other matches proue for the moſt part vntoward. Thirdly, <hi>The truly religious will be ruled by the Law of God, and will not be led after their naturall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For here <hi>Ruth</hi> leaueth the young men, and taketh an old man, becauſe the Law ſo bound her, as ſhe conceiued, taking <hi>Boaz</hi> for the neereſt Kinſman: becauſe ſuch as be truly religious, haue denied themſelues, and doe reſigne themſelues wholly to Gods good pleaſure and will, ſaying as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Not my will, O Father, but thy will bee</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 26. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>done.</hi> Hence was it that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did abſtaine from his Miſtreſſe; <hi>Dauid</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſmiting <hi>Saul,</hi> when twice he might haue done it, to get the kingdom; he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would waite, and endure much affliction; for he that beleeueth, ſaith <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> maketh not haſte. And hence is it, that ſuch as feare God, dare not follow the courſe of the world, but doe reſtraine their nature, and their deſires, and do endeauor to pleaſe God in all things. If this be the grace of the religious, let men hereby trie themſelues, and bee as God wiſheth them to bee, and as Religion and<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 29. Pſal. 86. 11. and 119. 5. Iames 1. 27.

For in ſuch a caſe there cannot be a full perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the euent; the poorer and meaner party
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:1830:152"/> may iuſtly feare contempt, and vſually ſuch a one feareth the alterabilitie of mans nature, though hapely good words may paſſe betweene them for the preſent. And therefore in ſuch a caſe it is good and fitting for the partie, of whom kindnes is expected, to giue to the other ſome tokens of aſſurance, not to doubt, nor feare, as <hi>Boaz</hi> doth in this place, and in the words following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will doe thee all that thou requireſt.</hi> By this <hi>Boaz</hi> taketh away her feare and doubt, in that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth her marriage.

And therefore may wee reſt vpon an honeſt mans word, though in theſe dayes many would bee held honeſt, which make no conſcience of breach of promiſe. In that <hi>Boaz</hi> here maketh her a promiſe of marriage, and ſo contracteth himſelf vnto her, but yet <hi>de futur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi> as it is ſaid, &amp; conditionally, as the two next ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhew, we may note, that <hi>it is lawfull to betroth</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 21. 9. Deut. 20. 7. Mat. 1. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>and contract our ſelues one to another before marriage.</hi> It was an vſuall thing among Gods people in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; which betrothing is either lawfull or vnlawfull: lawfull, which is made by parties that may lawfully marry, which be free in their choiſe, of yeeres of diſctetion to make their choiſe: and therefore contracts made of ſuch as bee within degrees forbidden, of contrary religions, betroth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already to others, or defectiue in nature, or wanting iudgement what they doe, or being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:1830:152"/> gouernment of Parents and not free, are not to bee allowed. Now further, this lawfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting is either conditionall, or abſolute, and the ſame <hi>de praeſenti,</hi> or <hi>de futuro,</hi> I take thee, or I will take thee to be my wife. If conditionall, then it bindeth no farther then the obſeruing of the condition bindeth; for if that be not kept, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties bee free, vnleſſe they giue their bodies in the meane ſpace one to another. If it bee abſolutely made, and by ſuch as may ſo contract themſelues, they be man and wife before God, and may not be ſundred one from another. Theſe things are to be therfore conſidered of in contracts, vſed before marriage, for the parties better ſettling of their affections one vpon another, for the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting themſelues with the conditions and qualities of each other, and to fit themſelues for houſe-keeping, and more conuenient liuing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, hauing made ſome honeſt prouiſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For all the citie of my people doth know, that thou art a vertuous woman.</hi>] The reaſon why hee yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to take her to wife: her portion was her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, for which ſhe was generally commended of all. This reaſon did the more confirme her, and eaſily remoued away feare, when ſhe might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vpon what ground he was induced to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with her. Hence may ariſe many leſſons: firſt, that <hi>vertue maketh euen the poore and ſtrangers too to become famous,</hi> as may appeare in this poore wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow a Moabiteſſe woman. So it made <hi>Dauid</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the dayes of <hi>Saul,</hi> though hee ſought to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:1830:153"/> obſcure his name; and likewiſe <hi>Barnabas</hi> in the Primitiue Church: for vertue will not bee hid, neither can it. And therefore ſuch as deſire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne, labour for vertue. Is not <hi>Abigail</hi> famous for her wiſedome? <hi>Ioſeph</hi> for his chaſtitie? <hi>Moſes</hi> for his meekeneſſe? <hi>Samuel</hi> for his iuſtice? <hi>Dauid</hi> for his zeale? <hi>Ehud, Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Iephte</hi> for their fortitude, and ſo the ſeuen and thirtie Worthies of <hi>Dauid</hi> for their valiant acts? <hi>Eſter</hi> for her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility? the ſinfull woman for her penitencie? the ſonnes of <hi>Ionadab</hi> the ſon of <hi>Rechab</hi> for their temperance? This is the way, and the beſt way to get ſame and true honour for euer; and yet few tread aright in this path, but rather they will make themſelues ſo notorious by villany, that all may know them to be vicious perſons, without ſhame, without bluſhing, like thoſe which <hi>Eſai</hi> &amp;<note place="margin">Iſai. 3. 9. Ier. 6. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeake of, which would not hide their ſins, neither bee aſhamed for them. Secondly, that <hi>the godly and vertuous will take notice of ſuch as bee vertuous among them:</hi> for ſo doe here all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Bethlehem, the people of God; becauſe they loue vertue, hauing it in themſelues, they deſire to encourage others that be ſo, and reioyce therein, and therefore doe they ſpeake thereof, and ſpread abroad the name of it, to make the parties which be vertuous, to be honoured. This is comfort to ſuch as liue well, though they doe not, nor may thereby ſeeke praiſes, yet ſhall they be taken notice of. And by this may men conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of themſelues whether they be vertuous, if they will take notice of graces in others, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycingly
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:1830:153"/> ſpeak thereof, to the honour and praiſe of the vertuous. Thirdly, that <hi>a godly man will take a wife for her vertues,</hi> as <hi>Boaz</hi> doth here <hi>Ruth;</hi> ſo did <hi>Dauid</hi> for her vertues chuſe <hi>Abigail:</hi> for a<note place="margin">Pro. 31. 10, 11.</note> vertuous woman is louely, and her price, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, is farre aboue the Rubies: the heart of her husband may ſafely truſt in her, ſo that hee ſhall haue no need of ſpoile. Let men therefore in marrying make this choiſe; for ſuch a woman<note place="margin">Prou. 12. 4. and 11. 16.</note> is a crowne to her husband, and ſhe retaineth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And yet this is the leaſt reckoned of in theſe dayes: but now beauty, wealth, honour and friends, are the motiues to make marriages. Fourthly, that <hi>a good report for vertue in a woman, is a good portion, and a meanes of preferment:</hi> Thus came poore <hi>Ruth</hi> to ſo honourable and rich an husband, hauing neither wealth, nor friends. For ſuch a woman hath the beſt and moſt durable helpe of true loue, euen vertue; ſhe hath the Lord to ſpeake for her, and to procure her fauour, and to cauſe her to bee beloued. This ſhould make women to ſtriue for vertue, and to get a good name from it, and not for beautie and braue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre: for a good name is better then riches, then<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7. 1. Prou. 22. 1.</note> precious oyntment, and rather to bee choſen then great riches. Let Parents hence learne to bring vp their daughters vertuouſly, it is a good portion and meanes of preferment. This may comfort poore maidens which bee vertuous, and want friends and goods, by a good report yet may they match well; let them ſtriue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though they want goods, yet to get grace
<pb n="998" facs="tcp:1830:154"/> and good conditions, as pietie and Religion in heart; and modeſtie in countenance, apparell, and geſture; let them preſerue chaſtitie, and not bee giuen to youthfull company; let them bee skilfull in good huſwifrie, painfull alſo and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, &amp; hauing power to gouerne the tongue; if thus they be beautified and enriched, they haue a better portion then many pounds, and faire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the wiſe in heart, ſo as they will giue a good man contentment: for beauty is fading,<note place="margin">Prou. 31. 30.</note> and fauour deceitfull and vaine, but a woman that feareth the Lord, ſhall be praiſed.</p>

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:1830:154"/> Learned; preuent long ſuites of law; put Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers to ſilence in corrupt pleading, and ſaue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pounds contentiouſly miſſpent, preuent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in buying and ſelling, and many other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, which miſerably fall out for want of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the truth, which men ſhould and would doe, if they hated falſhood and lying, if they had a hearty loue of the truth, if they would caſt off pride and the deſire of vaine praiſes, and couetouſneſſe, and the greedy deſire of gaine; for theſe hinder the truth; and where theſe reigne, hardly will truth bee acknowledged as it ought, or reigne among men as it ſhould.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That I am thy neere kinſman.</hi>] Foure things might moue him thus ingeniouſly to confeſſe himſelfe ſo nigh a kinſman to thoſe poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Firſt, his loue to the truth, ſo to ſpeake as the thing was. Secondly, his holy and religious reſpect vnto the Law of God, by authority whereof ſhee made claime to him. Thirdly, his humility and vprightneſſe of heart, not diſdai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his godly poore kindred. Fourthly, her owne vertues, and his loue which he bare to her for the ſame. (Of rich and poore kinsfolks I haue ſpoken before in Chap. 2. 20.) Here obſerue, that <hi>a louing, godly, humble, and vpright-hearted rich man will readily confeſſe himſelfe of neere kindred to his poore kinsfolke, if they be vertuous:</hi> for vertue maketh them honourable with the vertuous, though pouertie make them contemptible to the world. And therefore for the poore to get an acknowledgement of them from their rich
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:1830:155"/> kindred, let them be vertuous, that whereas they want goods, grace may procure them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and reſpect: for poore and lewd are not worthy the acknowledging, being contemptible both in body and ſoule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Howbeit there is a kinſman neerer than I.</hi>] So that <hi>the nighest to a right, are first to be preferred thereto:</hi> this is here implied; and this reaſon and equitie will yeeld. Therefore <hi>Boaz</hi> honeſtly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth heere mention of this other kinſman, to whom <hi>Ruth</hi> ſhould firſt haue gone: for both <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi</hi> and ſhee were miſtaken in this, to come firſt to <hi>Boaz</hi> for the right of marrying her: yet ſee how courteouſly and louingly hee anſwereth her, teaching, that <hi>ſuch as demand in ſimple ignorance a matter at our hands as due, and yet in ſome ſort not ſo, wee are meekely to informe them, and not ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to reiect them,</hi> as great Ones now will doe: for a ſimple errour is pardonable, and it is a fruit of goodneſſe to informe them in the right: and this would preuent contention and ſtrife, which otherwiſe might grow thereupon for want of better information. Let this then reproue thoſe which gladly take occaſion from ſuch miſtakes, to laugh at and ieſt away the parties, making themſelues very merry with the parties ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, though their meaning be both good and honeſt.</p>

                     <hi>Tarry this night.] Boaz</hi> deferreth to performe the kinſmans part for a ſpace, though very ſhort: and ſeeing it was night and now dangerous for her to goe alone from thence, hee aduiſeth her to tarry there that night in the floore.

Some are worſe, euen <hi>Iudas</hi>-like, who for gaine will betray their friend; or play <hi>Achitophels</hi> part, turne his counſel againſt him for hope of fauour, when he thinkes his friend downe the wind, and another like to ariſe: ſuch falſe and faithleſſe hearts may now be found more than enow, who alſo will expoſe their friend into any danger or loſſe, ſo they may get or ſaue thereby. Let men therefore learne ſoundly to try, before they too haſtily truſt the pretended, rather then truely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended loue in theſe dayes: for now is falſehood in friendſhip, for that commonly euery man lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth another for himſelfe onely, as experience ſheweth: for otherwiſe true friends will be as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan,</hi> who valued nothing of a Kingdome for his friend <hi>Dauids</hi> ſake; they will be like <hi>Huſhai</hi> in aduiſing for <hi>Dauids</hi> welfare; as <hi>Barzillai</hi> in relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him in diſtreſſe, and in ſhewing him kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe when moſt were againſt him, as <hi>Abiſhai</hi> in expoſing himſelfe into imminent danger for his ſafetie. What friends can be found like the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Mariners to <hi>Ionah,</hi> who in a tempeſt ſtroue with all their powers to ſaue him, with danger of all their liues? or like the Nurſe of <hi>Mauricius</hi>

                     <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> the husband of <hi>Mary</hi>) and would preſerue right to his neighbour. And thirdly, for that he had an honeſt and true intent to marry her, if ſo hee might, and therefore hee would not offer her diſhoneſty; though many of vnbridled affections make ſuch oportunities, ready motiues to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of abaſing themſelues one with another: becauſe (forſooth) they mind to marry: Of which euill in this Booke elſewhere I haue ſpoken.<note place="margin">See Verſe 14.</note>

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:1830:157"/> two extremes in buſineſſes to be auoided: the one is too great haſte, where need is not: and this is raſhneſſe, puniſhed in good <hi>Ioſias,</hi> and in<note place="margin">2.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">2. Sam. 20. 5.</note> the matter is to be conſidered of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee may iudge when to make haſte, and when to take more time and deliberation: for that is not raſhly attempted, which is firſt vndertaken with good aduice, though with ſpeed executed. Secondly, done ſeaſonably, as the circumſtances of the time, place, and perſons require. Thirdly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is done by our calling warrantably. When a man faileth in theſe, though hee take time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, hee is but a raſh Aduenturer.</p>

                     <hi>That if hee will performe to thee the part of a kinſman;</hi>] That is, if hee will marry thee, and raiſe vp the name of the dead: for he is before me by right to take or refuſe thee; ſo as if he will haue thee, thou canſt not refuſe him: then take him, and ſo an end hereof betweene vs. Though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth many wayes, that <hi>Boaz</hi> had an earneſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to <hi>Ruth,</hi> yet would hee not wrong the kinſman, if hee would haue her: for <hi>a good and a iust man, euen in what hee deſires, will not wrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother:</hi> becauſe the Law of righteouſnes bindeth<note place="margin">Ier. 22. 3.</note> him to iuſt dealing, of which hee maketh conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

Herein alſo may iuſtly be reckoned ſacriledge, robbing of Churches, or Church-men of their maintenance allowed by God, and the good Lawes of our Land, by not tything, or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deceitfully.

                  <p>
                     <hi>But if hee will not doe the part of a kinſman to thee.</hi>] Theſe words <hi>Boaz</hi> vttereth as the ground of his promiſe to marry with <hi>Ruth,</hi> to wit, if hee the kinſman refuſe her: for <hi>when one renounceth his right, it is then free for another:</hi> for the releaſe made, is a ſetting free of that which before was ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is for direction to ſuch as take houſes, or grounds. It is a common complaint to ſay, He hath taken my houſe and my grounds from me: But often vniuſtly, as when the Lord letteth not lands or houſes, but to a limited time, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expired, the ſame is free to let to another, except either cuſtome bind to let the preſent poſſeſſor to haue the refuſall, or that ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be made, which bindeth an honeſt man to keepe it. Beſide this, there is indeed a friendly courteſie in the Land-Lord to offer to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Inioyer that which hee hath, before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but he is not ſimply bound ſo to doe, but only of good wil. Yet muſt I needs acknowledge, that it is not a neighbourly part for any one out of a greedy couetouſneſſe, to vnder-myne the poſſeſſour, or by any indirect meanes to procure from him at the Land-Lords hands, his houſe or lands: for this is againſt the Law of loue, to doe as wee would be done vnto, and not to doe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, what wee would not that they ſhould doe vnto vs, as the Law and Prophets teach, and our Maſter Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth; and yet this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice now for want of loue. Note againe how warie <hi>Boaz</hi> is in making her a promiſe to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:1830:159"/> marry with her, it is done cautelouſly, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of vpright dealing betweene him and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For, <hi>as euery promiſe is to be made of an honeſt man with due conſideration,</hi> (becauſe once made, it bindeth, except there be a releaſe) <hi>ſo eſpecially the promiſe of marrying one another;</hi> both for the weightines of the matter (nothing being ſo much concerning the welfare, or downefall of man in this life) as alſo for the indiſſolubleneſſe of the knot; for here is no releaſing one of another, but they muſt liue together till death. And therfore let vs learne to bee warie in making this match: and to doe this, firſt, conſider theſe two things before mentioned, and weigh them well to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent haſte and raſhneſſe herein. Secondly, how fit or vnfit the marriage is, and what good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons there be to perſwade to it, or diſſwade from it. Thirdly, what is required before the marriage to further it, or elſe which might hinder the ſame. We may not raſhly, and vnaduiſedly runne into this holy ordinance, as many doe, firſt, vpon foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, light, and vnaduiſed loue. Secondly, vpon ſtrong and vnbridled luſt, violently preſſing them to ſudden contracts, and often to filthy vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, like bruit beaſts, which haue no vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Thirdly, vpon a feare to loſe the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of enioying one another, if friends ſhould know it, therefore they will contract themſelues, and giue themſelues one to another, and that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtly, to force friends to conſent. Fourthly, couetouſneſſe, when men are carried away, not with the loue of the partie, but with the greatnes
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:1830:160"/> of a portion. Theſe, and ſuch like, make haſtie matches, at leaſure to be repented of. Here it may be demanded, <hi>Why</hi> Boaz <hi>made an (if) of the other Kinſmans mind and good will, ſeeing firſt he was the nigheſt Kinſman, and had ſecondly, the Law of God to mooue him thereto; was it not vncharitableneſſe?</hi> I anſwer, No: for hee knew not his kinſmans mind, as it appeareth by his triall of him the next day. Againe, hee knew well, that albeit nature and Religion tie men to doe a thing; yet world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings will not doe their dutie. <hi>Cain</hi> had Nature, Reaſon, and Religion, to loue his brother <hi>Abel;</hi> ſo had <hi>Saul</hi> to reſpect <hi>Dauid;</hi> but theſe preuailed with neither of them, no more then the Law here was of force to mooue this worldling; for ſuch a one he was, as ſhall be ſhewed in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then will I doe the part of a Kinſman to thee.] Boaz</hi> hauing laid downe the condition, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth his promiſe made in verſ. 11. yea, though the other refuſe her, he will take her: <hi>for one mans diſlike, maketh not true loue to decay in another mans heart:</hi> for true loue is fixed vpon the thing belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, without reſpect to other mens affections to the ſame; their liking may the more increaſe loue, but diſlike cannot vtterly remoue it, where it is firmely ſettled: this, experience telleth vs to bee true, in the loue of young perſons affecting marriage. And it were to bee wiſhed, that our loue were ſo ſtrong, that our ſoules were ſo glued to Religion, that though others diſlike, wee may not therefore ceaſe to loue it, but bee as <hi>Ruth</hi> to

                  <p>
                     <hi>As the Lord liueth.</hi>] This is an oath, Ier. 4. 2. This oath hee taketh, becauſe it was a matter of great importance, and for that he would put the poore woman out of all doubt, and that ſhee ſhould not feare the accompliſhment, though he was rich, and ſhe poore; he noble, ſhee meane; he an Iſraelite, and ſhe a ſtranger of <hi>Moab.</hi> From this note; Firſt, that <hi>it is lawfull to take an oath,</hi> againſt the Anabaptiſts aſſertion, of which ſee Chap. 1. 17. Secondly, <hi>That the godly vſe to ſweare by God,</hi> when they ſweare, and by none other; of this more at large alſo in chap. 1. 17. Thirdly, that the <hi>forme of an oath is diuerſly expreſſed, and not one manner of way;</hi> as thus, <hi>I ſpeake it before God; God is my witneſſe; The Lord knoweth; As the Lord liueth; I proteſt before the Lord; I call God to record,</hi> and diuers ſuch like, beſides the common forme, <hi>By God,</hi> and ſo forth; which I note, to taxe the vſuall ſwearing of many, who ſeeme to hate ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the common forme, and yet they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſweare too often in another forme: ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till is Satan to beguile them in that, and therein to make them guiltie of that, from which they take themſelues to be moſt free: but they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, for when God, or his name and attributes are at any time mentioned, for this end, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the truth of that which a man ſpeaketh, it is an oath. Let men take notice hereof, and ceaſe to be common ſwearers. Fourthly, that <hi>it is lawfull to ſweare in priuat caſes,</hi> as <hi>Ionathan</hi> did to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and he to <hi>Ionathan;</hi> the ſpies to <hi>Rahab,</hi> &amp; <hi>Boaz</hi> here to

                     <hi>Ruth,</hi> in caſe of neceſſitie, and in weightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. In ſuch caſes wee may vſe our lawfull liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but yet with great warineſſe, with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of the high Maieſtie of God, not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, not in paſſion, not without due aduiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <hi>the mind of another in the truth of that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> whether of things paſt, ſpoken, or done, or of things preſent, or of things to come, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be done. This is the end of <hi>Boaz</hi> ſwearing here. If this be ſo, then let men reſt ſatisfied with an oath, as <hi>Ruth</hi> doth here, and as in ſome caſes God would haue men ſo to do, for it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt<note place="margin">Exod. 22. 11.</note> confirmation of a truth that may bee, except the partie ſwearing either hath been conuinced, or is at that preſent conuincible, by good proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of falſhood. If this be the end of an oath, then alſo let men care to ſweare truly, that the mind of others may truſt them, and relye vpon their faithfull oath taken. But we haue cauſe to bewaile theſe times, in which there bee ſuch, as profeſſing Chriſtianitie, yet will vſe oathes, yea, and fearefull execrations to coozen with, to make their lyes and ſecret villanies intended, to bee the leſſe ſuſpected, as by miſerable experience ſome ſimple and plaine meaning men may ſpeake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deluded by faire ſhewes of godlineſſe, zeale of goodneſſe, words confirmed by oathes, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full execrations, and counterfeit letters, that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked hypocrites and Satanicall deceiuers might attaine to their vnlawfull deſires.

By which words it ſeemeth ſhe was riſen vp, as ready to depart, but that hee would not permit her ſo to doe, for the reaſons before mentioned: and becauſe the night is ordained for reſt, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith: <hi>At night man goeth to his rest.</hi> Neither is it ſafe for young women to bee abroad in the night; it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth not well, it befitteth not their ſex, &amp; may endanger their chaſtitie.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhee lay at his feet vntill the morning.</hi>] This is added, to ſhew their chaſte and contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: for if they had offended, the holy Ghoſt, who ſpared not <hi>Noahs</hi> drunkenneſſe, <hi>Lots</hi> inceſt, <hi>Dauids</hi> adultery, would not haue concealed this fact, if ſo they had thereof been guilty: They were both honeſt and feared God: and therefore they would not commit ſuch wickedneſſe, albeit they had occaſion offred. Whereby wee may learne, that <hi>where the feare of God and honesty beareth ſway, there chastity may bee preſerued, though occaſion bee offered to the contrary.</hi> Behold this here in old <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>az,</hi> and elſewhere in young <hi>Ioſeph;</hi> there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lechery in the one, nor ſtrength of luſt, nor youthfull wantonneſſe in the other: for there luſt is bridled, where the feare of God poſſeſſeth the heart, and honeſty lodgeth. To bee kept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from this euill, let theſe vertuous examples guide vs, that luſt ouer-beare vs not, as it doth in ſuch as ſeeke occaſions to ſinne in this kind: <hi>neighing,</hi> as <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>after their neighbours wiues.</hi> And ſuch alſo, though they ſeeke not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:1830:163"/> like the former; yet they eaſily take occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to offend this way, with virgins, with married wiues, and with thoſe whom they thinke to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with; and this laſt is held no offence at all by them: becauſe they thinke that marriage amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all. But firſt it is an argument of a ſtrong and vnbridled luſt, which ſhould not beare rule in Chriſtians. Secondly, if the man hap to die before marriage, (as who is certaine of life?) the woman being with child, becommeth infamous, and ſhee that ſhould haue beene a wife, is left as an harlot. Thirdly, it is an offence to the Church, being knowne, and puniſhable by the ſame, which offence the godly muſt auoid: <hi>Giue no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 32.</note> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to Iew, nor Gentile, nor to the Church of God.</hi> Fourthly &amp; laſtly, it beſeemeth not the holineſſe of the publicke ſolemnization of marriage, to which the parties ſhould come vndefiled, as the Aſſembly and Congregation of God doe in charitie iudge of them. Note beſides, that theſe two godly perſons kept themſelues chaſte, and how others accounted alſo godly, and that ſo were, yet were very fowly ouertaken in this ſinne of the fleſh, as wee haue example in <hi>Lot</hi> in a caue with his daughters; <hi>Iudah</hi> with <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar;</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> with <hi>Bathſhebah.</hi> From whence obſerue, that <hi>Gods owne deare Children haue not all the like meaſure of grace,</hi> nor power to reſiſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and to ſubdue their owne corruptions. In the holy Word of God wee ſhall find three ſorts of the godly: ſome hardly found fault with, their infirmities paſſed ouer with ſilence; ſuch a
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:1830:163"/> one was <hi>Iſaac, Boaz</hi> heere, ſo <hi>Ioſua, Samuel, Daniel, Mephiboſheth, Ionathan, Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Simeon, Anna,</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and others. Some are noted with their frailties and light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, being moſt excellent Saints of God, as <hi>Moſes, Iob, Ieremie, Hezechias,</hi> and <hi>Ioſias,</hi> and ſome others. A third ſort are ſtained with foule offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as <hi>Dauid</hi> with adulterie and murther; <hi>Iudah</hi> with inceſt, and ſo <hi>Lot; Aaron</hi> with Idolatry; and <hi>Peter</hi> with periurie: for the Lord affordeth not the like grace in equall meaſure vnto all. All are ſanctified: yet corruptions more ſway in one then in another, as theſe inſtances ſhew, and as experience daily teacheth. Therefore let vs not thinke to find the like grace in all, and the like mortification of corruption: for God diſtributeth his gifts and the meaſure, as it pleaſeth him. None are then to bee condemned ſimply for bad perſons, as if they were not in the number of Gods Saints; becauſe they bee not in all things like their brothren: for they, euen both ſorts of them may bee the Lords, and yet in ſome thing bee very much vnlike. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> inticed by his miſtreſſe, preſerued his chaſtitie: but <hi>Dauid</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced another mans wife, and lay with her. <hi>Boaz</hi> alone with <hi>Ruth</hi> would not ſinne in fornication: but <hi>Lot</hi> alone with his daughters committed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt. <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was a true Iſraelite without guile: but <hi>Iacob</hi> firſt called <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of whom came all the Iſraelites, diſſembled, &amp; lyed to his own father: <hi>Moſes</hi> a meeke man, but <hi>Ionah</hi> of a very froward ſpirit: and yet al of them good men, &amp; the bleſſed
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1830:164"/> Saints of God. This therefore iuſtly reproueth thoſe, who ſeeing men profeſſing Religion, and yet to differ in their courſes, ſome to liue vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouably, and others to giue great offence in their falls, though of infirmitie, doe vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them all as hypocrites, and as diſſemblers. Yea, this checketh them themſelues for deadly cenſuring one another, when if any man be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in any fault: they which be ſpirituall, ſhould<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> reſtore ſuch an one in the ſpirit of meekeneſſe, conſidering themſelues, leſt they alſo be tempted. If any man heere aske, <hi>Why doth not God make all his Children to be alike religiouſly minded one as well as another?</hi> I anſwer, the Lord may doe it for theſe reaſons. Firſt, for the good many times of the godly themſelues: for they are ſuffered to fall for their greater humiliation, the more to let them ſee their owne weakeneſſe, to ſhew that they ſtand not of themſelues; to make them the more to deny themſelues, not to bee lifted vp with any conceit of their owne goodneſſe, or merit; but to magnifie Gods mercy for their daily preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for his goodneſſe towards them: and after their fall returning to God, and feeling peace in their renewed Repentance, they will the more cloſely ſticke to God, more earneſtly pray, and more feruently loue him: for ſo great good the Lord workes in his Children after their falls; yea ſuch humiliation will bee wrought thereby in them; and ſuch comfort, ioy, and loue in God after their recouerie, as no outward croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor outward deliuerances can euer doe the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:1830:164"/> like. Secondly, for the further damnation of the wicked, who at the falls of the godly doe harden their hearts the more againſt all Religion, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to bee a vaine thing, and that ſuch as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and embrace it, are no better than others, and that the beſt be but hypocrites: becauſe they ſee ſome grieuouſly ouertaken; when theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſoules ſhould hereby be moued the more to feare their owne damnation, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and take a better courſe: for if the righteous ſcarcely bee ſaued; if they ſo hardly get out of their corruptions; if they bee ſo fearefully ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, who reade, meditate, heare the Word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre thereof, pray much, and humble themſelues with teares; where ſhall the wicked and ſinner<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 18.</note> appeare? How can the common and careleſſe Chriſtian bee ſaued? Thus ſhould they reaſon, to rowze vp their ſpirits to make them to ſeeke God, and feare damnation, and not take occaſion by the falls of ſome, to condemne the profeſſion of Religion it ſelfe in others, and ſo to make no account thereof in themſelues to the hardning of their owne hearts, and ſo heaping vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the iuſt deſerued vengeance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhe roſe vp, before one could know another.</hi>] That ſhee might bee gone away out of the floore before the light, or at the dawning of the day, very earely, ere others ſhould bee ſtirring. This ſhee did perhaps out of a ioy of heart, and deſire to bee with <hi>Naomi,</hi> to tell her the ſucceſſe of her counſell, which ſhe carefully followed, as it may ſeeme by her haſty relation of the matter vnto
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:1830:165"/> her mother in law, when ſhee came vnto her, as ſhall bee ſhewed in the 16. verſe. Note heere, that <hi>they bee not drowzie-headed, whoſe hearts are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp with their buſineſſe:</hi> they can riſe betimes, and preuent the day, whether it bee the deſire of getting goods, or enioying pleaſure, or to doe miſchiefe, which makes ſome not to reſt: or that it bee ſuch ioy as was heere in <hi>Ruth;</hi> or a good will to doe a thing, as in <hi>Abraham</hi> to obey God,<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 3. and 28. 18.</note> hee aroſe vp earely; ſo <hi>Iacob</hi> to get to his Vncles; <hi>Ioſua</hi> to find out the tranſgreſſour in the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate<note place="margin">Ioſua 7. 16.</note> thing, to put euill away from Iſrael; <hi>Dauid</hi> to go with that which his father ſent vnto<note place="margin">1.

So that let the heart be taken vp with loue, care, ioy, deſire, it will doe any thing; the ſpirit of drowzineſſe will bee ſhaken off: for it is the careleſſe minde which maketh ſlothfull. To bee therefore ſtirring, and to raiſe vp our ſelues out of the bed of idleneſſe, wee muſt ſet our hearts vpon our affaires. I might alſo note, how <hi>darkeneſse keeps vs from the knowledge of one another:</hi> therefore in darkeneſſe man feareth not the face of man, and ſo is bold to doe euill; becauſe hee is hid from the ſight of others: and as it is in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily darkeneſſe, ſo in ſpirituall; the ignorant and blind in ſoule dare do any thing, they bluſh not, neither be they aſhamed, which others enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are afraid to commit; neither can they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne one another: for the light of Truth they haue not.

Therefore let ſuch as would not bee ſuſpected, beware how they be in company alone together, when and where ſuſpicions may ariſe.

They are therefore reproueable, who bee wearie of well-doing; they would giue once, but not often, neither at any time much: and yet wee beg bread at Gods hands daily, and repine if wee haue it not, and not onely for the preſent, but for the time to come.

                     <hi>Then went Boaz.</hi>] That is, that morning, not deferring what he had promiſed, Chap. 3. 11, 13. where I ſpoke of the keeping of his word, which here he accompliſhed.

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:1830:174"/> why it was there, theſe may bee the reaſons. Firſt, for eaſie acceſſe of all ſorts, as well ſtrangers as Inhabitants to the place of iuſtice, from which none are to be kept backe. In open places is the more roome. Secondly, for the better manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of iuſtice in the ſight &amp; hearing of all, which taketh away ſuſpition of iniuſtice. Thirdly, for the preuenting of thronging by the concourſe of of people, not wholeſome, and ſometime dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in thoſe hoat countries. Fourthly, that ſuch as paſſed to and fro, might bee called into the buſineſſe, either as witneſſes, or parties ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, as it fell out in this Seſſion here with the kinſman comming at vnawares. Fiftly, becauſe the gates be the ſtrength and munition of the Citie: now, there for Magiſtrates to ſit, doth more grace their authority, who ſit there as Commanders in the place, able to command the whole Towne. Sixtly and laſtly, to put all that enter into the City, in mind of well-doing, and to take heed of euill. Theſe bee my coniectures: but whatſoeuer the reaſon was, this may wee learne, that <hi>publicke cauſes are for publicke places, and there to bee determined of:</hi> for in ſuch caſes the<note place="margin">Deut. 21. 19. &amp; 22. 15. &amp; 17. 5. and 25. 7. Gen. 34. 20.</note> Lord commandeth to goe vp to the gate of the Citie; as alſo it was the manner of the Heathen thereabouts, ſo to doe. It befitteth the cauſe, it preuenteth ſuſpition of ſiniſter dealing in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate; and publicke places doe grace more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then priuate meetings. And therefore this courſe is to be approued, and the priuate hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of publicke buſineſſes, as in criminall cauſes,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:1830:174"/> is againſt the Apoſtles Canon: and hereby great euils fall out; iuſtice is preuerted, and ſinne often vnpuniſhed, the offenders let goe for gaine, who ſhould bee made examples, that other might<note place="margin">Deut. 21. 21.</note> heare and feare.</p>

                     <hi>And ſate him downe there.</hi>] Seates were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, for him and the reſt, as the common place of iuſtice: which ſitting downe of him in the publicke place of iuſtice, ſheweth that he was a Iudge and a man of authority, and the beſt alſo in the Aſſembly, becauſe he tooke the firſt place. Note briefely, Firſt, that <hi>ſitting is the grauest gesture for Iudges and Magistrates in places of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> ſo euer ſet out, Prou. 31. 23. Mat. 19. 28. Reu. 20. 4. and ſo euer vſed in thoſe parts, and likewiſe with vs: which therfore is to bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the better ſetting forth of their authority, which they ſhould mind to grace by all meanes in the peoples eyes, for more reuerence ſake. Secondly, that <hi>God ſo guideth by his prouidence theſe worldly estates, that euer ſome are better men in place and dignitie then other ſome:</hi> ſuch a one was <hi>Iob,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 1. 1. &amp; 29. 7, 8, 9.</note> and ſo <hi>Boaz</hi> heere, for the preſeruation of peace in Church and Common-wealth: which hand of God wee are to prayſe him for, and to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to vphold this inequality of perſons: for elſe what would follow but diſorder and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and euery man would doe what hee liſt.<note place="margin">Iud. 17. 6. and 18. 1.</note> See this with our ſelues, when men of equality meet, and haue light occaſions offered: Oh how doe they ſcornefully behaue themſelues one to another! Thirdly, that <hi>men of place according to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:1830:175"/> their dignitie, may take their place, without staine of pride:</hi> for <hi>Boaz</hi> doth it: it is alſo their right, and it preſerueth order, and that dignitie which God hath giuen them. Therefore may they take their place, yet ſo, as they be humble, and not hautily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, neither proudly contend for it, and ſo diſturbe publicke peace, which ſhould euer bee moſt deare to euery one, eſpecially to men in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. If men may take their place, then ſuch are blame-worthy, which with an enuious eye find fault with any for ſo doing: and they alſo doe amiſſe, which out of too great humility (to ſpeake but ſo of it) doe loſe their due place, and there withall ſo much of due reſpect vnto their perſon and degree, yeelding their place to the leſſe worthy, and ſo lift vp the other in pride, and make themſelues of leſſe eſteeme. But as there be ſome ſuch ſo lowly-minded, ſo are there others too highly-conceited of themſelues, who will take place of their betters, aſſuming to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues more then they deſerue: this is pride and hatefull arrogancie.</p>

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:1830:177"/> for that publicke actions, and publicke cauſes ſhould bee more neere and deare to vs than pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate: for in publicke things there is a reſpect vnto the priuate, which is more ſafe in the ſafety of that which is publicke. Therefore ſuch as doe neglect wholely publicke wel-fare, and attend onely to the priuate good of their owne eſtate, they doe amiſſe, and euen ſo, as if a member of the body ſhould ſee to it ſelfe, and neglect the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is the way at length to bring ruine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelfe, which it ſeekes to preuent. This repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſuch as being able and fit men for publicke buſineſſes, doe labour yet by all meanes to auoid them.

This ſo great neglect of that which is publicke, is no ſmall detriment to to the Common-weale; this great care of euery man for himſelfe and for his owne priuate, and little or rather none for the publicke, is the cauſe of ſo great, and ſo many euils euery where among men. Secondly, that <hi>men are to yeeld readily to lawfull authority commanding, whatſoeuer worth they be of, which are ſo commanded.</hi> Men muſt bee like the Iſraelites, and do as they ſaid they would doe to <hi>Ioſua,</hi> euen to obey readily in all things,<note place="margin">Ioſ. 1. 16, 17, 18.</note> and ſo to vphold his authority, as alſo they would oppoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt ſuch as would not obey. <hi>Dauid</hi> was very obedient vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> albeit hee

In Iudah were an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twelue Cities, which was but a little Circuit, euen ſo many Courts for iuſtice and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:1830:182"/> iudgement, to which the townes and villages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted which belonged to them, and in them, as is before noted, were all matters handled, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going any farther. This would preuent long iourneyes, and ſo great expences of ſubiects; this would ſooner bring cauſes to the hearing, and matters to an end: this were the way to haue ſinne more eaſily and ſooner puniſhed. The Iſraelites did not ſtay till quarter Seſsions, till Aſſiſes eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry halfe yeere; till which time cauſes muſt reſt, priſoners lye and dye in priſon, or elſe learn ſuch villanies there, as they will be euer the worſe for, when they be deliuered.

And
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:1830:189"/> therefore let vs looke whether we, in going to vrge others to their dueties, haue a calling by ſpeciall reaſon ſo to doe, elſe may we be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for too buſy-bodies; likewiſe whether wee haue a conſcience in our ſelues, that we bee not guiltie of vnwillingneſſe to do our duety in that which we preſſe others vnto, leſt it bee ſaid to vs, <hi>Phyſician, heale thy ſelfe.</hi>

                     <hi>And hee ſaid, I will redeeme it.</hi>] This ſheweth that hee was a worldling: for this kinſman, after ſo long a famine, had ready money to purchaſe, but not a penny to giue to poore <hi>Naomi</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> as <hi>Boaz</hi> did. <hi>Boaz</hi> was rich, and had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to redeeme the inheritance, but he was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull; ſo he was a rich man in the world, but not of it, as a worldling is: for <hi>a worldling is one of the world, louing it, ſeeking it with greedineſse, hoarding vp, and ready euer to be buying, but without mercy to the poore,</hi> as this Kinſman ſeemed to be. By this, learne to behold a worldling, and a godly rich man; both getters, both full of coyne, both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to purchaſe, herein they differ not: but the one hath regard to the Law of God, ſo not the other, one hath a mercifull heart to be liberall to the poore, and ſo hath not the other; the one in his purchaſe hath reſpect to the good of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the other regards wholly and onely his owne commodity; for hee is vnſatiable, being like the dry ſandy ground, which drinks vp raine; like the Dropſie, the Horſe-leech, the Graue, and barraine Wombe, which be neuer ſatisfied; no more is the couetous worldling, his encreaſing
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:1830:190"/> and getting ſatisfieth him not; but rather ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him the more greedy of gaine.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſaid Boaz.</hi>] When hee ſaw him forward to buy the land, and as one prepared thereby, in his vnderſtanding, to haue the offer of <hi>Ruth</hi> made to him, then he propounded her, teaching this, that <hi>then a matter is fit to be ſpoken of, when the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may ſeeme to bee prepared thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> muſt prepare the way before Chriſt come with the Goſpell: and ſo muſt <hi>Paul</hi> be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with humiliation, before the Lord tell him his good pleaſure, and put him into his function

And therefore let vs learne this wiſedome to put it alſo into practice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi, thou must buy it alſo of Ruth the Moabiteſse.</hi>] The reaſon of this ſpeech of buying firſt of <hi>Nao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> then of <hi>Ruth,</hi> is this: <hi>Naomi</hi> was <hi>Elimelechs</hi> widdow, to whom the land did belong, and whom the kinſman ſhould haue married; but ſeeing ſhee was too old to marry, and to beare children; and now <hi>Ruth</hi> yong, and the widdow of one of <hi>Naomi</hi> her ſonnes, ſhee was to ſupply <hi>Naomi</hi> her defect; and ſhee, when the land was to bee redeemed, muſt alſo be married to the Kinſman, albeit ſhee was a Moabiteſſe: for Gods Law was not partiall, but extended in Iſrael, in that caſe, for which the Law was giuen to the woman, whether ſhee were an Iſraeliteſſe, or of another nation, and married to an Iſraelite. Note here, that <hi>Boaz</hi> at the firſt propounded not ſo much as he intended: yea, <hi>what is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is often last propounded,</hi> as here, <hi>or whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concealed,</hi> vſuall with Statiſts: as we may ſee in<note place="margin">1. Sam. 18. 9, 17, 21, 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Saul,</hi> who propounded the marriage of his daughter to <hi>Dauid,</hi> as if hee honoured and loued him, when the end of his policie was to deſtroy him. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> propoundeth tranquillitie and reſt to Iſrael, and that he had care to ſaue them from ſo great coſt &amp; trouble, as to go vp to Ieruſalem,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:1830:191"/> there to worſhip; hee would for their eaſe, haue them worſhip at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> the golden Calues: but this their fleſhly eaſe, effected by this deuiliſh policie, was not intended, but the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of himſelfe, and the confirming of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">1.

Seeing that leſſe is at firſt propounded ſometime then intended, and the maine thing now and then concealed, as theſe examples ſhew, and as wee may ſee it in the Serpent that Grand <hi>Politician</hi> vnto <hi>Eue;</hi> let men learne to be wiſe to ſift the drift, if they haue to do with men of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of a deepe reach; elſe auoid them, if their owne apprehenſion bee too ſhallow to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, leſt by credulity they bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne. But <hi>it may here be asked, ſeeing Boaz did propound not that which at the first he chiefely aimed at, whether it be lawfull ſo to doe?</hi> I anſwer, Yes: for to propound one thing before another, is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, neither to conceale ſometime part of our mind, as wee may ſee in <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſo aduiſed by<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16. 2.</note> God himſelfe to ſpeake: yea that may bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſpoken, and in ſome caſe, which may ſeeme to further a thing in hand, and yet bee the way to preuent, and tend to the well-fare of another, as the counſell of <hi>Huſhai</hi> to <hi>Abſalom;</hi> which counſell<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:1830:191"/> intended of <hi>Huſhai</hi> his part, which differs much from the damnable policie of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam:</hi> which ſubtill men moſt commonly follow and put in practice. We may alſo obſerue here main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for <hi>Naomi,</hi> and marriage for <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſo as both the widdowes were cared for: for <hi>of widdowes</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exo. 22. 22, 23.</note> 
                     <hi>God hath euer had an eſpeciall care.</hi> To a widdow muſt <hi>Eliah</hi> goe to preſerue both his owne and<note place="margin">1.

And therefore let men haue reſpect to the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, as <hi>Iames</hi> exhorteth, who maketh it a<note place="margin">Iames 1. 27.</note> chiefe ſigne, or character of our Religion before God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The wife of the dead.</hi>] This ſheweth how <hi>Ruth</hi> came to haue a right in an Iſraelite to marry with him, becauſe her husband was an Iſraelite, and the Law was, that the widdow of ſuch a one, the next kinſman ſhould marry, if hee died without iſſue. But yet this is not all: for <hi>Orpha</hi> was the wife of the dead too; ſhee was married to <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> brother to <hi>Mahlon:</hi> but <hi>Ruths</hi> Religion and comming with <hi>Naomi</hi> to dwell among Gods people, giue her this benefit of Gods Law. By which wee may learne, that <hi>Religion, and not any earthly priuiledge, doth interest vs into the Law of God and the benefit thereof:</hi> for otherwiſe <hi>Orpha</hi> had as much right by the Law to the Kinſman
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:1830:192"/> and to <hi>Boaz</hi> as <hi>Ruth</hi> had. If therefore we claime a benefit by the Word, let vs bee religious: for godlineſſe hath the promiſe of this life, and the life to come: but vnto the wicked no hope, ſo long as they ſo remaine, but to them the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and curſes be due.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To raiſe vp the name of the dead vpon his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>] This was <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and ordained<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 5.</note> for diuers cauſes: firſt, to ſhew that by death, the right of inheritance was not loſt: for it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>his</hi> inheritance, which figured out this, that by death we loſe not our right of Heauen, which is called our inheritance. Secondly, to prouide that the widow ſhould not be without children; thereby typing, or figuring vnto vs, that the Church ſhould not be left barren. Thirdly, to make the dead to liue againe, and his name to remaine among ſuch as were in the land of the liuing: ſo teaching, that the dead ſhould riſe, and enioy Life euerlaſting. Fourthly, to preſerue the<note place="margin">Deut. 25. 6.</note> name of the dead, that it ſhould not bee put out: ſo giuing vs to know, that God keepeth our names in remembrance, and we ſhall not periſh. Fifthly and laſtly, to preſerue the honour of the firſt borne; when hee that was begotten by the kinſman, was to beare the name of the dead, and not his name which begot him: ſo God would teach vs, that Chriſt, the firſt begotten, ſhould be honoured; and ſuch as were begotten by ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Fathers, the Miniſters of the Word, ſhould carry Chriſts Name, and from him bee called Chriſtians, &amp; not by the name of their Teachers,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:1830:192"/> as if they begot people to themſelues, but onely to Chriſt, to keepe vp his Name amongſt his Saints for euer. Beſides theſe ends, and this typicall and figuratiue meaning, wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that <hi>by Moſes Law, kindred were to vphold the name of their houſe, that it periſhed not:</hi> for it<note place="margin">Pſal. 109. 13. Ier. 22. 30.</note> was a great curſe to haue a mans name rooted out. And though that Law doe not bind vs, yet the Law of naturall loue, and louing reſpect to our owne kindred, the name and credit of thoſe which we come of, yea, and the honour which our family may come vnto by obtaining antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſhould make vs vphold it: for ancient fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies haue a certaine honour vpon them for anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie ſake, though otherwiſe but poore and meane. Now, to keepe vp a name, and that in<note place="margin">See Verſe 12.</note> good credit, we muſt obſerue and fulfill theſe things firſt, plant Religion, and keep that among vs: for ſo God will vphold and ſtrengthen vs, and bleſſe vs and ours: the godly ſhall be had in an euerlaſting remembrance, but the name of the wicked ſhall rot. Secondly, bring vp our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſo teach them to bring vp theirs, in honeſt courſes and callings, and not to let them liue idly and vainely: for nothing preuents euill more, nor vpholds a mans eſtate better, than to liue with induſtry and diligence in a calling: and what ouerthroweth houſes, and bringeth men to ruine, making Gallants to ſell away their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, but that they haue beene idly brought vp, without callings, without honeſt imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Thirdly, keepe our Genealogies, from
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:1830:193"/> our Anceſtours, and the increaſe of our poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to behold therein the Lords bleſſing, and to reioyce in our encreaſing the Lords Church. Fourthly, we muſt helpe them vp againe, which by Gods hand fall into decay: common charity, and naturall loue doe perſwade hereunto, and our owne credit alſo, in keeping our name from contempt, if that reſpect may moue vs: for the more poore, the leſſe eſteeme, and the greater contempt. Fifthly, we muſt labour to preferre our kindred to good marriages, to good places, as they ſhall be fit, and occaſions offered, as farre forth as we ſhall be able to the vtmoſt. Sixtly, we muſt loue one another entirely. Which ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: firſt, by our enquiring after one another, when we be ſeparated. Secondly, by viſiting one another neere, and ſending one to another far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off. Thirdly, by being glad to ſee any of them, though deſcended many degrees from vs: for the further off, the better appeareth the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of our kindred, and the greater encreaſe of our houſe. Fourthly, by being deſirous that one ſhould make vſe of another, before any other whatſoeuer: for this combineth them very neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in affection. Fifthly and laſtly, to defend them in their iuſt cauſes, and to be as one man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue them from wrongs and iniuries offered them vniuſtly: this doe, but yet onely as farre as may ſtand with publike peace; for that muſt bee preferred before kindred, yea and our owne eſtate and liues, leſt we runne into factions and parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and ſo cauſe ciuill diſſention, which muſt
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:1830:193"/> be moſt carefully auoided: but otherwiſe, being no breach of publicke peace, no wrecke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, nothing againſt iuſtice and legall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, we muſt defend them, and in their good courſes vphold them in loue and charity. If euery houſe and familie would doe thus, ſhould not men be happy? ſhould not euery one reſt in peace vnder his owne vine? The rich friends would ſupply the want of their poore kindred, and the poore would honour them, and lay downe their liues for them. Charity would rule as Queene; and iuſtice would ſit in peace; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would flouriſh, and the Land would bee bleſſed, and people made renowned, admired and feared. Before I end this verſe, here it may be asked, <hi>Whether the Law of Moſes, mentioning a</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is to bee vnderſtood of a naturall brother: for the Law was in vſe before it was<note place="margin">Gen. 38. 17, 18.</note> written, and ſo then vnderſtood by <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Thamar,</hi> God diſpenſing therewith: and <hi>Naomi</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chap. 1. 13.</note> thus vnderſtood it alſo: though, if there bee no brother, the nigheſt kinſman then muſt marry the widdow; therefore <hi>Ruth</hi> claimed it of <hi>Boaz,</hi> and <hi>Boaz</hi> did propound it to the neerer kinſman: beſides theſe, Learned men doe take the Law to be ſo meant.</p>

                     <hi>Verſe 6.</hi> And the Kinſman ſaid, I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme it for my ſelfe; lest I marre mine owne inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: redeeme thou my right to thy ſelfe: for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not redeeme it.</head>
                  <p>THe Kinſmans anſwer to <hi>Boaz</hi> concerning his propounding of <hi>Ruth</hi> to him. He refuſeth her, and giueth his reaſon: then, he reſigneth his right to <hi>Boaz,</hi> and repeateth againe the words of refuſall, as a reaſon of his reſignation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the Kinſman ſaid, I cannot redeeme it for my ſelfe.</hi>] He could before redeeme it, but now, he ſaith he cannot, he loued the land, and in that reſpect hee was ready to fulfill the Law, but hee cared not for the woman, the poore widdow; and in this regard the Law was not reſpected of him. So we ſee, how that <hi>Worldlings are partiall obſeruers of Gods Law:</hi> ſome part they take, and ſome part they leaue, euen as it liketh them; they looke to the bare Letter, but not the ſpirituall meaning; they ſhunne the act, but for words and thoughts they doe take no care; the ſinnes in the groſſeſt kind they auoid, but the leſſer, as they account them, they make little or no conſcience of; that which concerneth their pleaſure, and their profit according to the Law, they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to doe, but on the contrary, where the Law croſſeth them, that they caſt behind them, as this Kinſman here; they hate popiſh faſts, but loue drunken feaſts; they abhorre ſuperſtitious worſhip and coſt about it, but they can bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:1830:194"/> to liue of ſacriledge, and the maintenance due to Miniſters, though giuen by Anceſtours to the Church with an execration or curſe vpon ſuch as ſhall change them to any other vſe; other mens dueties they can heare of, and vrge the Law to them: but to be told of their owne, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the performance thereof, they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. The reaſons of this partiality are theſe: Firſt, the want of the true loue of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent feare of the power and authority of the Lawgiuer: for where this loue and feare is, there will be reſpect had to all the Commandements,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 6.</note> without partiality, as we may ſee in <hi>Dauid,</hi> and in other holy men of God. Secondly, the vnbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled luſt of man vnſubdued, &amp; not brought into the obedience of Chriſt by the power of the Word, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh: for if the Word<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 5.</note> ruled in their hearts, they would not be thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall in obeying Gods will, but bee like <hi>Zacharie</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 6.</note> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> walking in all the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God vnblameable. Thirdly, their loue of pleaſure and worldly profit more than God himſelfe, which appeareth by this, that they will loſe neither of theſe for Religion ſake. <hi>Herod</hi> will doe many things, but his pleaſure with <hi>Herodias</hi> he will not forgoe. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> will giue much, ſell all to giue to the Church, but not giue all, they will thinke more of the matter, than giue away all at once, though ſtill they will pretend it: ſuch <hi>Herod</hi>-like, and ſuch <hi>Ananiaſses</hi> there bee, which haue not denied their pleaſures, nor their profits for Religion ſake: which therefore maketh
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:1830:195"/> them partiall in their obedience to God. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the loue of praiſes of men, and feare of them,<note place="margin">Ioh. 12. 42, 43.</note> make them to make balkes in their ſeruice to God, now omitting this, then that, and heere treſpaſſing, and there offending againſt the Law; to get this mans praiſe, and not to diſpleaſe that; being bound onely to man, but looſe in their hearts to follow their owne wils, in reſpect of any conſcience towards God. Fifthly, the deadneſſe and benummednes of their conſciences (for want of looking into Gods Law, and the ſearching out of their wayes by the ſame) which neuer troubles them for neglect of their dueties, nor for the breach of any part of the Law. Sixtly, a carnall perſwaſion of their good eſtate, and that in thus doing, they be not ſo much to blame; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thriue in the world, they get many friends, and they ſee others alſo to be their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with them herein of the beſt ranke in the world, and ſuch as profeſſe to be better, yet are taken tardie in foule faults; and therfore are they hartened hereby in this their halting ſeruice and partiall obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to God. Let vs take knowledge of this to bewaile it, then to remoue theſe cauſes, and to labour for the contrary graces, that wee may ſerue God with all our hearts. Note againe, how he ſaith, <hi>I cannot,</hi> when hee might haue ſaid, <hi>I will not:</hi> but hence we ſee, that <hi>what man will not doe, that hee excuſeth with, I cannot doe.</hi> So did the high Prieſts and Elders anſwer our Sauiour, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they could not tell, when indeed they would<note place="margin">Mat. 21. 27.</note> not tel him what they thought of <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſme:
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:1830:195"/> for <hi>I cannot</hi> is a more modeſt ſpeech than <hi>I will not,</hi> and it carrieth a reaſonable excuſe with it: for in reaſon we thinke, that what a man cannot doe, he ſhould not be vrged to doe; and therefore doe men vſe to ſay they cannot doe that, which they haue no will to doe; either of a froward ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is to be condemned; or vpon reſpect of ſome inconueniences, which may in ſome ſort be excuſed with <hi>I cannot doe,</hi> to wit, with conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie: but this muſt not excuſe or hinder our duety of charitie, to neglect the helping of our brother in this his neceſſity, or to omit to doe what we ought, or may well doe: for ſo to ſay, <hi>I cannot,</hi> is vntruth, and an euill excuſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lest I marre mine owne inheritance.</hi>] Thus this Kinſman excuſeth his refuſall of <hi>Ruth.</hi> He might thinke, perhaps, being a worldling, that he might marre it, if he married a young woman, and ſo bee ouercharged with children, or that in marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ruth,</hi> hee ſhould bee burthened with poore <hi>Naomi:</hi> or he hauing children by another, ſhould by this bring a new charge vpon him, and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcord by children of diuers women, which ſeldome agree, as may be ſeene in <hi>Iſhmael</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> and <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes: or he might haue another wife (as vpon this place ſome doe note) and ſo by taking this, the houſe might be filled with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as wee may ſee when <hi>Abraham</hi> tooke <hi>Hagar</hi> to <hi>Sarah,</hi> alſo in the wiues of <hi>Iacob, Elka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> his two wiues, and as is very like betweene the wiues of <hi>Lamech,</hi> the firſt Bigamiſt. Or laſtly, he might thinke, hauing a good inheritance of
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:1830:196"/> his owne, by taking <hi>Ruth,</hi> and be getting a ſonne to the dead, and ſo perhaps hauing no more, ſhould thereby raiſe vp the name of the dead vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his inheritance, and want one for his owne, which he would not ſo marre, as he ſaith, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer his thought was, thus to moue him to ſpeake. We may learne, that <hi>a Worldling is carefull to preſerue his outward eſtate,</hi> that it be not marred, as he here ſpeaketh: for ſuch a one is wiſe in his generation: hee loueth his riches and wealth, and he feareth want: and it is not amiſſe to care to get honeſtly, and to preſerue our lands and goods, when wee haue them: for they are Gods gift, and wee are made his Stewards ouer them, to keepe them carefully, and to imploy them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will, and not after our luſts: yea, this wee are commanded to doe, and vrged by<note place="margin">Pro. 27. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Gen. 33. 13, 14. 1. King. 21. 1. Tim. 5. 8. Prou. 31. 1. Cor. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Salomon</hi> thereto by many reaſons: this care had <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob,</hi> &amp; <hi>Naboth;</hi> and the Apoſtle telleth vs, that euery one is to prouide for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie, as the good Huſwife doth; and parents are to lay vp for their children, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe, except they be painefull, frugall, and do care to vphold their eſtates: and therefore thus farre a worldling is not to bee reproued; but as farre forth as he careth for the world with neglect of Religion in himſelfe, and in his family, (when as firſt we muſt ſeeke Gods Kingdome, as Chriſt<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 33.</note> commandeth, and that in the firſt, and not in the laſt place) and as farre as he keepeth it with ſhip-wracke of conſcience, vpholding it by ill meanes, and hauing no care to doe good works:
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:1830:196"/> which two, that is, the neglect of Gods ſeruice, and of keeping of a good conſcience, if they bee auoided, men may in the care of their outward eſtate, bee well warranted to keepe and preſerue Gods bleſſings beſtowed vpon them, euer in faith to God, and loue to our brethren: for, with all care wee ought moſt of all to vphold our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eſtate, that we marre not that, and loſe our hope of Heauen; but let the care of the one put vs in mind of the care of the other, as euery way more excellent. Note farther from this man, that <hi>Worldlings thinke by obeying Gods Law, they ſhall marre their earthly estate;</hi> that Religion will ouerthrow them: and thus they imagine, firſt, becauſe they ſee Gods Word to croſſe their worldly courſes whereby they doe vſe to get and vphold their eſtate, which indeed, cannot ſtand with Religion, pure, &amp; vndefiled before God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe they are perſwaded that they muſt doe, as men of the world doe, elſe they ſhall not thriue, howſoeuer Religion it ſelfe binds them to the contrary. Thirdly, becauſe they truſt not God, nor rely vpon his Word. Fourthly, for that they ſee many, which goe for religious men, to be poore, and not to thriue, as they doe, or deſire to doe in the world; which they impute to their ouerſtrictneſſe in Religion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe conclude with themſelues, that to liue after the Rule of Gods Word, is the next way to beggery, which they will by their worldly cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes preuent, if they can. But let vs beware of ſuch Atheiſticall thoughts, and be farre from theſe
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:1830:197"/> imaginations of Worldlings, firſt, becauſe riches<note place="margin">Deut. 8. 18.</note> are from God, and not by man; man cannot make himſelfe rich by any meanes, if Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bleſſing be not aſſiſtant thereto; experience alſo teacheth vs this; when wee ſee men induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yea, prouident and wiſe, as others, yet can they not attaine the halfe that others come to. Secondly, becauſe theſe outward bleſſings, euen theſe are promiſed to ſuch, as doe liue well and<note place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> obey God. Thirdly, for that many men in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing carefully to pleaſe God, and to ſerue him, haue come to great wealth, as we may reade of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Ioſeph, Iob, Boaz</hi> here, <hi>Dauid, Iehoſhaphat,</hi> and many others. Fourthly and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that men by their rebellion againſt God, haue loſt great eſtates, and depriued themſelues thereof, and their poſterity by their wickedneſſe, as is euident in the example of <hi>Saul, Ieroboam,</hi> and others. And therefore let vs not thinke our worldly eſtate to become worſe, by carefull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing after Gods Lawes, but rather better and more ſure, as <hi>Iobs</hi> was, about whom the Lord made a Hedge for his ſafety. And remember for a concluſion, that ſuch as feare the Lord, ſhall want nothing that is good. <hi>O taste, and ſee,</hi> ſaith<note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 8, 9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Dauid, that the Lord is good! bleſsed is the man that trusteth in him. O feare the Lord, ye his Saints: for there is no want to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that feare him. The yong Lyons lacke and ſuffer hunger: but they that ſeeke the Lord, ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> Note thirdly hence from theſe words of the kinſman, that <hi>the feare of worldly loſſe in a mans outward estate, maketh him
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:1830:197"/> neglect the Law of God,</hi> as this man doth here: for Gods Word preuaileth not, it hath not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power ouer the conſcience of a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man; becauſe his heart is glewed to his<note place="margin">Luk. 18. 22, 23.</note> riches, a baſe feare through vnbeliefe poſſeſſeth him, that he himſelfe may come to want; and the loue of riches ſo bewitcheth him, as hee valueth them aboue the Lords Precepts, contrary to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 72. 103, 111. and 19. 9.</note> account of Gods Word. That wee may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come therefore obedient to Gods Law, let vs caſt off this Atheiſticall and Heatheniſh feare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Redeeme thou my right to thy ſelfe.</hi>] The kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is heere willing that <hi>Boaz</hi> ſhould take his right: that, which before hee ſaid hee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme himſelfe, now hee is contented that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould redeeme it. So <hi>Worldlings are content to yeeld ſometimes their right vnto others,</hi> as namely that which they cannot come by, that which they cannot keepe, that which they cannot haue, but with more coſt then the thing is worth; or when by getting a little, there is hazzard to loſe much; and likewiſe that which for preſent feare they yeeld vnto, as <hi>Benhadad</hi> did reſtore Cities vnto<note place="margin">1. King. 20. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>Ahab,</hi> becauſe he was in his hand, and in perill of his life, which hee would by that meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme. Otherwiſe Worldlings willingly forgoe nothing. Therefore their yeelding of their right at any time vpon the foreſaid by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reſpect, is not thankes-worthy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For I cannot redeeme it.] None but can pretend ſome excuſe or other why they doe not what they ought.</hi> In this man may we obſerue two things:
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:1830:198"/> inconſtancie, and want of charity: for before, he would redeeme it, now he will not; before yea, now nay. <hi>Three things make men inconstant:</hi> firſt, leuity of minde: this is a naturall infirmity, and to be pardoned. Secondly, ignorance, and want of fore-ſight of the incoueniences, which maketh him raſh at firſt, and to repent afterwards, and ſo to change his mind, as this kinſman doth: this is ſomewhat excuſable, though not altogether without blame: for a man is to doe that which is gone out of his mouth, though it be to his owne<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.</note> hinderance, if nothing elſe hinder the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. Thirdly, diſhoneſty, which is, when a man maketh no conſcience of any thing he ſaith or doth, but as hee ſeeth aduantage therein to himſelfe; ſaying and gaine-ſaying, doing and vndoing as he ſeeth it to tend to his owne profit: this is flat knauerie, and iuſtly to be condemned. Of this we muſt take ſerious knowledge, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the firſt in vs, preuent the ſecond by good conſideration and deliberation, and hate the laſt, as deteſtable falſhood and diſhoneſtie, not to be practiſed among Chriſtians. Vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe in this kinſman herein appeareth, that he hath no care of the name of the dead, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto the two poore widdowes, <hi>Naomi</hi> and <hi>Ruth;</hi> the land he loued &amp; liked well, but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men he would haue nothing to do with; he had a mind to inrich himſelfe in worldly ſubſtance, but he had no will to ſhew mercy to the poore: for a worldling thinkes himſelfe borne for himſelfe, ſeeking his owne good, but not the good of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:1830:198"/> contrary to the true propertie of charity.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> This vncharitableneſſe muſt we take heed of, and abandon ſelfe-loue the true cauſe thereof; and labour for Charity, the Euidence of our Faith in God, and true Vnion with our Brethren in Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Now this was the manner in former time.</hi>] It was no new deuice, but an old cuſtome, though no where in Scripture mentioned before.

Mat. 15.</note> with their traditions, by ſaying it was ſaid of old, and done by the Forefathers. Thus the Papiſts ſeeke to grace their ſuperſtition and wil-worſhip: for that which is of old, hath many Approuers of al ſorts, which maketh it to be of ſuch eſtimation.
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:1830:199"/> Seeing this is ſo, let vs learne to know true Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity from counterfeit; the antiquity of truth, which is of God, and that of error, which is of the Diuell: and that which wee find to be antiquity of truth, that to vphold, and to reiect the other: ſo ſhall we approue of the truth of our Religion, as moſt ancient; and renounce Poperie, as a new nouelty, and a religion ſprung vp but of late.

<pb n="394" facs="tcp:1830:202"/> God, as did <hi>Moſis</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> in drawing neere<note place="margin">Exod. 3. 5.

Ciuilly: this pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or putting off the ſhoo was firſt, for conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie to waſh the feete<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> next, for confirmation of ſale of land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as heere: and thirdly, for diſgrace, when the kinſman would not performe the part of a kinſman, according to the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 25. 9.</note> This is not here meant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for by the Law, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, after ſhe had claimed marriage of the kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man priuately, then alſo ſhee complained to the Magiſtrate; if the kinſman ſhould refuſe to doe the office of a kinſma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then is ſhe to plucke off his ſhoo, &amp; ſpit in his face; which ſome expound, to ſpit before his face.

Heere in this verſe and the reſt following, we may ſee the happy ſucceſſe of that which <hi>Boaz</hi> tooke in hand: for it was a good matter, for a good end, and done in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Now, <hi>when a thing which is lawfull, is taken in hand, and done well, to a right end, there may bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a good iſsue:</hi> as may bee ſeene in <hi>Dauids</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon <hi>Goliah;</hi> it was an honorable attempt, the manner of his proceeding was lawfull, hee waited for it, and had publicke authority to ſet him forward, and the end was Gods glory, and ſafety of Iſrael: for God is with ſuch, and his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall aſſiſt them, and his fauour ſhall giue them

And therefore if wee would proſper, let vs obſerue theſe things in our attempts: for if the end bee good in thy intendment, and the thing vnlawful, the act is ſinnefull; if the matter bee good, and the end ſiniſter, this marreth the matter: but if the matter and end bee as they ſhould be, yet if the manner be amiſſe, wee may for this miſcarry, as we ſee in <hi>Dauids</hi> remouing of the Arke.

Seeing what we ſee and heare, maketh vs fit to bee produced for witneſſes, when occaſion ſhall ſerue, let vs in matters of moment, for vpholding of truth, iuſtice, and peace, obſerue well, what we doe ſee, and heare, that we may be true and faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,

                     <hi>That I haue bought all that was Elimelechs, and all that was Chilions and Mahlons.</hi>] Here is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whereof they were witneſſes: one thing is here ſpecified, the other in the next verſe. This heere is of the purchaſe of land, whereunto hee calleth them to bee witneſſes, for better confirmation of the land, and the right thereof to himſelfe: for<note place="margin">Deut. 19. 15.</note> witneſſes are for to eſtabliſh a matter.

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:1830:204"/> Miniſtery of the Word, in ſolemnizing of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and ſuch like. It argueth an honeſt intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not caring who ſeeth it; it will cleare him of the ſlander or ſuſpition of fraud and circumuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And therefore in ſuch caſes labour to bee publike: for onely they which do euill, or intend it, hate the light: honeſt minds care not who ſeeth them. It is no good ſigne of a good intent, when buyers will marke in ſecret to buy lands of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of ſuch as bee young prodigals, or old Spendthrifts, or ſuch as muſt ſell for need; for thoſe hope to make a prey, and to get that for a little, which is worth much: but ſuch gaine is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt: and where fraud and oppreſſion is, there will<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4.</note> God be an Auenger. Laſtly, note hence, that <hi>it is lawfull for a rich man to buy land of others, when it is offered,</hi> as here, when as alſo need is of ſome parcell for a ſpeciall vſe, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did buy a<note place="margin">Gen. 23.</note> burying place, and <hi>Omri</hi> the hill of Samaria: and<note place="margin">1. King. 16. 24.</note> when it is for good vſes, as for the maintenance<note place="margin">Leuit. 27. 22.</note> of Gods publike Worſhip, to build an Altar, as <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> did: ſo now to buy land for<note place="margin">Gen. 33. 19. 2. Sam. 24.</note> maintenance of the Word, for Scholes of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for Hoſpitals, and to ſet poore on worke. Againe, hee may buy, to helpe a poore man, that for need muſt make ſale to ſupply his want with money: but ſuch a purchaſe muſt bee made in<note place="margin">Leuit. 25. 14, 15, 16, 17, 25.</note> mercy, in great equity, and without oppreſſion, in the feare of God. And thirdly, when the ſaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is his kinſman, then to buy, as a friend and kinſman, to preſerue the land in their name, but eſpecially to do the kinſman good, &amp; that in two
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:1830:204"/> things: in giuing to the vtmoſt what it is worth, and in being ready at all times to let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme it againe, if euer hee ſhall bee able. Thus may a rich-landed man buy land: but heere hee muſt take heed, firſt, that he intice not others to make ſale of their eſtates, which bee not willing thereto, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, which wrought that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe<note place="margin">1. King. 21. 2, 4.</note> which afterwards inſued. Secondly, that hee make not a prey of a poore man, not of any<note place="margin">Leuit. 25. 14.</note> other, which ſtandeth in need to ſell. Thirdly, that hee buy not vpon a greedy deſire, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable couetouſneſſe, to haue all about him: for<note place="margin">Eſai. 5. 8, 9, 10.</note> the Prophet denounceth a woe and iudgements againſt ſuch. Fourthly, that hee buy not in the dayes of a generall calamity, but rather imploy his money in workes of mercy: this was a vertue<note place="margin">Nehem. 5. 16.</note> in <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> They therefore erre, who thinke they may buy as much as they can, if they haue money, conceiuing no other vſe thereof, but to buy and purchaſe therewith only for themſelues, to make themſelues great. And this reproueth thoſe, which are ſo greedy of buying land, as they runne into the Vſurers bookes, and borrow what they may, to purchaſe, till the vſe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney eate vp a good part of the land, &amp; themſelues at the laſt become beggers, and ſo leaue their children poore, their friends in bonds, and not a few lenders, perhaps, in the lurch: ſuch is the fruit of greedy couetouſneſſe. But, wee may ſay, as it is lawfull to buy, ſo is it lawfull to ſell. True, of which before ſomewhat is ſpoken already, yet heere a little more of the ſame matter. A man
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:1830:205"/> may ſell, to ſuſtaine his pouerty happening by Gods hand, as did the Egyptians; to recouer<note place="margin">Gen. 47. 18, 20.</note> their liuelihood and health, as did the diſeaſed<note place="margin">Mark. 5. 25.</note> woman; to pay debts, as did the poore widdow,<note place="margin">2. King. 4. 7.</note> to be free from bondage, and to ſaue her life: for goods and lands are for our vſe: and liberty, life, health, and credit are more to bee eſteemed then any lands or poſſeſſions. A man may alſo ſell to others for their need, as <hi>Ephron</hi> ſold to <hi>Abraham</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 23. &amp; 33. 2. Sam. 24.</note> a field, <hi>Hamor</hi> to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Araunah</hi> to <hi>Dauid.</hi> And thirdly, for to relieue the want of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as they did in the Primitiue Church. In<note place="margin">Act. 2. 45. and 4. 36, 37. &amp; 5. 1.</note> ſuch caſes may men ſell, but not to vphold prodigality, whoredome, idleneſſe, pride and vanity.</p>

Mat. 18.</note> both to beware of offences to all ſorts; and alſo where wee perceiue that any might take an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, there wiſely to preuent it in them, if wee can, and not bee like ſuch as giue themſelues to all licentious libertie to liue as they liſt, as almoſt euery one doth in theſe dayes, not caring for a good name of a graue and ſober Chriſtian, or of adorning their holy profeſſion, or of diſpleaſing the godly minds of others; but to liue onely like Libertines after their owne luſts, opening the mouthes of the Aduerſaries to ſpeake ill of the Goſpell of God. Secondly, from <hi>Boaz</hi> wee may learne, that <hi>a godly man in his marrying is guided by Gods Law, and hath reſpect vnto Gods good pleaſure therein:</hi> ſo had <hi>Abraham</hi> in matching his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> in marrying of his ſonne <hi>Iacob:</hi> for ſuch as be godly, make the Lords Will &amp; Word their Rule in all things, much more in a matter of this weight and conſequence; they know it
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:1830:207"/> to be Gods ordinance, and therefore will aduiſe with God about it: yea, they know that God hath not left men herein to their liberty and luſt, to marry as they like beſt; but hath limited them, and in his Word hath taught them with whom, how, and to what end to marry. And therefore in marrying we muſt be ruled by the Lord, which will appeare by theſe things: If we ſee what cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wee haue to marry, before wee enter into this troubleſome eſtate, as Reaſon and Religion ſhould perſwade vs; If we ſee that wee haue a iuſt cauſe to marry, then to conſider with whom God alloweth vs to marry; If we ſeeke out ſuch a one, as not onely with whom we may marry law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, but alſo fitly: &amp; therefore to pray earneſtly to God for ſuch a one: for God maketh fit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> and a vertuous woman is his gift. It is a happy thing to match fitly, and more hard then to match lawfully. If laſtly, we vſe marriage<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> as God hath appointed, for increaſe of poſterity, and to auoid fornication, the firſt end was before<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.</note> the fall, the latter after; and withall for mutuall ſociety, helpe and comfort, which one ought to haue with another: which cannot be, except there bee fitneſſe, grace, true loue, humilitie and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But who are thus led by the Lord in their marrying? Men ſeeke wiues now without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Gods will and pleaſure: they follow the luſts of the eyes, the luſts of the fleſh, and pride of life. Thirdly, we may obſerue how <hi>the vertuous are to match ſo, as they may raiſe vp a ſeed of the righteous among Gods people:</hi> for the preſeruation
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:1830:208"/> of the Church and Religion, as <hi>Boaz</hi> heere had a care to raiſe vp the name of the dead vpon his inheritance. But this cannot the married doe, except they themſelues be true Louers of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and haue a ſpeciall care to traine vp their children religiouſly, firſt, in knowledge of God, elſe are they Atheiſts; of the true God, elſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Idolaters; and of the true worſhip of this God, elſe but will-worſhippers: then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them in the Doctrine of faith, without<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2. and 11. 6.</note> which grace they can neuer profit by the Word, nor euer pleaſe God; the ſumme of which beliefe is ſet downe in the Articles of our Creed. Next, to teach them how to pray aright; which is the meanes to conferre with God, to ſpeake to him, to obtaine bleſſings from him, and without the practice whereof men are but as beaſts, and a marke of ſuch as thinke there is no God. The<note place="margin">Pſal. 14.</note> ſumme of our prayer, and the perfect rule of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for matter, and manner, and end, is ſet downe by our Sauiour Chriſt. Laſtly, to teach them obedience, and to walke in Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, without which, all knowledge and<note place="margin">1. Iohn 2. 4. Iames 2.</note> faith is vaine: the fumme of what we are to obey, is in the ten Commandements, which children muſt be taught and inſtructed in. Here may bee noted this alſo from the words, that <hi>the dead doe liue againe, as it were in their posterity, which keepe their inheritance:</hi> for children and the preſeruation of their fathers inheritance, doe keepe aliue the name of the dead. Therefore let children haue a care hereof, leſt they deſtroy the name of the

                  <p>
                     <hi>That the name of the dead bee not cut off from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his brethren.</hi>] This is another end, the other being the meanes to preuent this: for the raiſing vp of the name of the dead, preuenteth the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it off from among the brethren. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the word <hi>brethren,</hi> hereby is meant others than very naturall brethren: for the people of God before and vnder the Law, as in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church vnder the Goſpell, were wont to call one another brethren, of which I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before out of the third verſe. For <hi>cutting off:</hi> this may bee when one will not marry to haue children, or marrying, are not bleſſed of God with children, or hauing children, are cut off by Gods iuſt iudgement, and ſo the name periſheth,<note place="margin">1.

And therefore let people pray for this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of marriage, and thanke God for their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and fruit of the wombe. <hi>Abraham</hi> moſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 2.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement teacheth: which being our duety, wee muſt care to obſerue, both to the dead and to the liuing. To the dead, as <hi>Boaz</hi> doth heere: now their honour we preſerue, when we ſpeake of them with honour, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did of <hi>Abner;</hi> when<note place="margin">2. Sam. 3.</note> wee maintaine their good name againſt calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ſlanderous reports; &amp; when we imitate their vertues, and ſeeke to vphold their poſterity, eſpecially when they ſhall deſerue well, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſteps of the dead in well-doing. Thus ſhall wee truely and with praiſe preſerue their honour, though we doe not as the Papiſts dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate dayes in honour of them, and make them Interceſſours to God for vs, to the great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Chriſt. And as we ſhould maintaine the honour of the dead, ſo ſhould wee the honour of the liuing, by acknowledging their dignity, in
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:1830:209"/> age, place and gifts; by ſpeaking thereof as is meet, without enuy or diſdaine, and by doing reuerence in our outward behauiour according to their dignity. Heere may alſo bee noted, that <hi>men of place and authority may ſoone leaue their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in a low estate:</hi> for <hi>Elimelechs</hi> wife was poore <hi>Naomi,</hi> and glad of the helpe of her daughter in lawes gleanings.

This may fall out ſometime by Gods hand in puniſhing the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they can leaue nothing to children; ſometime for triall, as in <hi>Iobs</hi> caſe, who was brought to great miſery; and ſometime a mans owne doings may bring him vnder the power of authority, which may iuſtly depriue him of his honor and eſtate, as it befell <hi>Abiathar</hi> in the daies<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Yee are witneſses.</hi>] That is, as if <hi>Boaz</hi> had ſaid, not onely of the ſale and purchaſe of the land, but alſo of this my marriage with this yong woman, <hi>Ruth:</hi> which here we ſee to be publike, and in the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:1830:210"/> Gate of the Citie, in a ciuill Court and place of iuſtice. Whence uote, Firſt, that <hi>marriages are to be made publikely before ſufficient witneſses,</hi> as was <hi>Iacobs,</hi> this here, and that to which our Sauiour<note place="margin">Iohn 2.</note> was bidden. This is fit for the honour of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, for the better ratification thereof, and to preuent pretences of marriages: for if marriages were not publike, but priuately huddled vp, ſome might pretend marriage, and liue together as man and wife in ſhew, and yet be but lewd liuers: ſo others wearie of one another, might ſay they were not married, and ſo vnlawfully ſeparate themſelues. Therefore let marriages be publike, and in a publike place, as here it was, and as now by our Lawes we bee bound thereto; and auoid priuate making of marriages, and in corners, for they are often made in haſte, and end vnhappily. Secondly, that <hi>marriage in old time was onely a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill action:</hi> there was no need of a Miniſter to make it, it was lawfully and ſufficiently done, when it was made openly, by ſuch as might mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, among the people, as we may ſee in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> of <hi>Iacob, Eſau, Samſon.</hi> Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth the Papiſts that make marriage a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if marriage were onely lawfull in the Church, and not among the very heathen: when yet from the beginning it is common to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and allowed to all ſorts. True it is, that we doe make ſuch marriages lawfull onely when mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters make them, but this is not with a papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call opinion of a Sacrament, nor for that our Church condemneth marriages otherwiſe made
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:1830:210"/> in other nations, as vnlawfull, but the Church and State haue ſo ordained, for the greater reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Gods ordinance, when his Miniſters ſhall bleſſe the ſame, in the publike Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the prayers of the Church; and when they ſhall teach them their dueties, which doe marry: Thus gracing Gods holy ordinance by their praying and preaching, the one for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the other for inſtruction, and therefore worthily ordained, and ſo of vs to be religiouſly obſerued.</p>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an hereticall opinion to forbid ſecond marriages, which the godly practiſed, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle alloweth vpon good reaſons. But <hi>to haue two wiues at once is not lawfull:</hi> for it is contrary to the Lords firſt inſtitution of marriage, who ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together but one man and one woman: it is<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> againſt the Apoſtles Doctrine, who teacheth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery<note place="margin">1.

And wee may reade of the firſt offenders, how one was out of the Church a blaſphemous <hi>Lamech,</hi> and the other in<note place="margin">Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 4. &amp; 26. 34.</note> the Church a prophane <hi>Eſau.</hi> And albeit holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had many wiues, it was their fault; God onely being pleaſed to paſſe it ouer in his mercie: but
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:1830:213"/> allow thereof hee did not, as appeareth by the<note place="margin">Malac. 2. 15.</note> Prophet <hi>Malachies</hi> words: And therefore are they not herein to bee followed. It is a bleſſed Law, which of late time hath beene enacted in this Nation, againſt marrying two wiues at once. In praying that <hi>Ruth</hi> might bee firſt like <hi>Rachel,</hi> who was amiable and louely to <hi>Iacob;</hi> and then like <hi>Leah,</hi> who was fruitfull; they may ſeeme to pray for two things of the Lord: the firſt was, that there might bee true loue and good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king betweene <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth: for true loue and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 25. Col. 3. 19. Gen. 24. 67. 1. Sam. 1. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>good liking ought to bee betweene husband and wife ſpecially:</hi> ſo commanded, ſo practiſed by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and by <hi>Elkanah,</hi> and other godly men; and it is that which maketh marriage comfortable, and the parties to liue quietly together with mutuall contentment. Oh therefore let vs pray for this loue, and not onely pray, but endeuour to vſe the beſt meanes to procure and hold it! And to effect this, the married perſons are to take heed of ſtrange affections, which might alienate their minds one from another, then to behold rather the good qualities and vertues of one another, than the infirmities, and things to bee found fault with: for loue couereth a multitude of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. Young perſons before marriage cannot ſee one anothers faults, and if they doe ſee them, yet their loue is ſuch as they can paſſe them by. Why, is not loue in marriage as ſtrong: nay, ſtronger, ſeeing now two are made one? <hi>Iſaac</hi> tooke <hi>Rebecca,</hi> and ſhee was his wife, and he then loued her: but now men loue their <hi>Rebeccaes</hi> afore
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:1830:214"/> marriage, and then taking them for wiues, they hate them, or not loue them as before. Moreouer, the married parties are to bee ready to performe mutuall dueties cheerefully: yea, they are to ſtriue which ſhould be moſt louing in their due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of loue, and ſhould alſo prouoke one another thereto. Laſtly, they ſhould often thinke of the ſolemne couenant made betwixt them, and by that and other godly reaſons preſſe themſelues, the husband himſelfe, and the wife her ſelfe, to their dueties: yea, they ſhould bewaile their owne, and one anothers corruptions before God, and pray againſt them, and for Gods good graces to make them duetifully louing one to another: thus doing ſhall they, by Cods bleſſing, both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and keepe loue. The ſecond thing they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, was the encreaſe of children, which was<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28. Zach. 8. 5. Gen. 9. 1.</note> the firſt bleſſing to man and woman, when God had made them; and the firſt and principall end of marriage, and which God promiſed vnto his people. In old time it was held. a reproach for<note place="margin">Luke 1. 25. 1. Sam. 1. 26. Leuit. 20. 20. Ier. 22. 30. Gen. 20. 18. 2. Sam. 6. 23. Pſal. 127. and 128.</note> women to be barraine; and the Lord did threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it as a puniſhment: yea, and inflicted it vpon ſome. Surely it is the want of a bleſſing, as the Pſalmiſt teacheth. And therefore let vs pray for this bleſſing, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Iſaac, Manoah,</hi> and <hi>Hannah:</hi> from which theſe are farre, who ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as they might bee without hope of children; ſuch alſo as murmure at Gods bleſſing, through vnbeliefe, fearing not to haue to maintaine them, vnlike <hi>Leah,</hi> who comforted her ſelfe and praiſed<note place="margin">Gen. 29. 32, 35.</note> God for children. Some would haue ſome one or
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:1830:214"/> two, as it were to play withall, or to inherite that they haue, but many they cannot away with: but theſe are moſt to be condemned, who vſe meanes and medicines to preuent children, or ſin in the ſinne of <hi>Onan,</hi> whom the Lord ſlew: for it is<note place="margin">Gen. 38. 9.</note> murther before the Lord. Laſtly, from the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er made to the Lord for loue betweene them, and the encreaſe of children, wee may obſerue two other things: Firſt, that <hi>loue betweene man and wife commeth of God, and is his gift:</hi> for as the Pſamiſt ſaith, it is God that maketh them that are in one houſe, to be of one mind: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to pray to him for it, and where it is, to praiſe him heartily for the ſame. Then, that <hi>Children are the gift of God:</hi> as may appeare by many Scriptures, and by the prayers made to<note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 38. &amp; 127. and 128.

And therefore muſt we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them from God, as <hi>Eue</hi> did, and <hi>Leah;</hi> if wee want them, pray to him for them, as <hi>Hannah</hi> and others did, and then care to bring them vp well, and dedicate them to Gods ſeruice in ſome lawfull calling, in thankefulneſſe for his ſo great a mercy.</p>

                     <hi>Which two did build the houſe of Iſrael.</hi>] That is, God made them fruitfull to bring forth to <hi>Iacob</hi> a familie, of whom came the Iſraelites the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people of God.

                     </note> commeth from a word which ſignifieth to build: ſo as the bringing forth of children, is as the building vp of an houſe, by which a familie is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the cohabitation of man and wife toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo wee call our kindred and ſtocke, our houſe. Note here howſoeuer men haue the name of the houſe, and by them commeth the poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be honourable, yet are <hi>women the builders vp of the houſe, and are the eſpeciall inſtruments of the encreaſe of posterity:</hi> for when men had no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it is ſaid, The women were barraine, and their wombs ſhut vp; and when men had any, it is ſaid, The Lord gaue the women to conceiue. In them therefore is either the encreaſe or decay of poſterity, yet both from God, as hee either pleaſeth to bleſſe or to deny the bleſſing. By <hi>Iſrael</hi> is meant <hi>Iacob;</hi> touching which name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> note theſe three things: the change of the name<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 28. &amp; 35. 10.</note> by God himſelfe, to comfort <hi>Iacob</hi> in great feare for his brothers comming againſt him, and to ſhew his more excellent eſtate then before: for the change of a name, was to expreſſe a more happy condition, as may appeare in a new name<note place="margin">Eſai. 62. 2. Gen. 17. 5, 15.</note> promiſed to the Church, and giuen alſo to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:</hi> and here before <hi>Iacobs</hi> name was called <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> it is ſaid, The Lord bleſſed him, and gaue him<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 26, 27, 28.</note> the name, ſo as with the change of the name, was the change of his eſtate foretold. The ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this name, which is the next thing, is, preuailing with God: whence wee in Chriſt are<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 28. Gal. 6.</note> called, The <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God: for that we preuaile
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:1830:215"/> with him through Chriſt. The third thing is the euent according to the name, for hee preuailed againſt <hi>Eſau</hi> by Gods mercy: for though hee<note place="margin">Gen. 33. 4. &amp; 36. 6.</note> came againſt him with foure hundred men, yet was his heart ſo mollified at the ſight of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as hee with teares embraced him for ioy of their meeting; and afterwards when <hi>Iacob</hi> was in Canaan, <hi>Eſau</hi> gaue way vnto him, and went into Edom, and left him the Land. Thus God made good his Promiſe to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and made him <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a true Preuailer: for God giueth no ſignes to his children, but he maketh the ſame good in the effects, and the euent anſwerable thereunto. So much for the words: but in this that theſe El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and people doe pray for a bleſſing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, from the conſideration of Gods former mercies to others; and alſo doe take their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from ſuch as did build vp Iſrael, Gods Church; and not Babel; Bethel, and not Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, we may learne; Firſt, that <hi>Gods bleſsings to others before vs, are a motiue to vs that come after, to beg the like bleſsings in the like caſe from God, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to himſelfe his good pleaſure and will,</hi> which, in asking the common bleſſings of the world, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the condition either to bee expreſſed or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: for Gods mercies ſhewed to others, are not onely for their preſent good which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, but to ſhew how ready the Lord is to ſhew the like mercie to others, if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by their ſinnes hinder not the ſame. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs conſider of Gods mercies to others, to bee thereby encouraged to aske the like of God
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:1830:216"/> for our ſelues in the like caſe, with ſubmiſſion to Gods good will and pleaſure. Secondly, that <hi>ſuch children are to be deſired, as may bee to build vp Iſrael,</hi> that is, Gods Church: ſuch theſe pray for heere. This is the moſt happy bleſſing of the wombe; thus ſhall the wife bee as the pleaſant Vine, and the children like Oliue branches, which a man may behold with comfort: for by them God is glorified in his mercy, the Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, parents comforted, and children made happy, ſonnes being as Plants growing vp, and<note place="margin">Pſal. 144. 12.</note> the daughters as corner ſtones poliſhed: theſe be the arrowes which make the man bleſſed that hath his quiuer full of them. But alas, how few<note place="margin">Pſal. 127. 5.</note> deſire ſuch children? Moſt deſire them for their name, for to poſſeſſe their inheritance after them, but not for the enlargement of Gods Church: for if ſo, we would not marry for meere pleaſure, as many doe; or for the world, as not a few doe: but in the Lord with ſuch as feare God, and ſo for Religion ſake, and haue a care to bring vp our children in the knowledge of God, and not in the corrupt manners of the world, and faſhions of the times, as moſt doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vanity; or but vnto meere ciuility, as many doe, which are well accounted of, yet neuer bent their thoughts to true pietie in the educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their children.</p>

Our meditation vpon this ſhould make vs thankefull to God, who hath for a long time made our countrey and fields Ephrata, and our cities and townes Bethlehem. And let vs take heed of ſinne, which will cauſe the Lord to turne our plenty into ſcarcity, and make a barren wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe<note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 33, 34.</note> of our fruitful Land, for the wickedneſſe of vs the Inhabitants which dwell in it: for wee doe greatly prouoke him to wrath, in abuſing his bleſſings to pride, idleneſſe, gluttony, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whoredome, and want of mercy to the poore, as did wicked Sodom in her fulneſſe. But let vs take heed: for the Lord will not euer ſtriue with vs thus in mercie; his iuſtice cannot euer ſuffer it.</p>
                  <p>The words, <hi>doe thou worthily,</hi> are read alſo thus, <hi>get thee riches;</hi> which may well ſtand, and may bee a fit requeſt for <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth</hi> after they bee married and haue increaſe of Children, teaching this, that <hi>marriage needeth maintenance,</hi> as we all know; for it is chargeable, and that in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, in houſekeeping, in bringing vp of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and in being liable to rates and ſeiſments, according to the ability of the parties married. And therfore let ſuch as inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to marry, prouide
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:1830:217"/> honeſtly aforehand for the maintenance of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did for <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſonne, and not<note place="margin">Gen. 24.</note> ruſh, through vnbridled luſt, as many young lads and laſſes, poore and beggerly doe in theſe daies, to their owne hurt, and the putting of a burthen vpon their neighbours, when they cannot main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their charge. If any haue improuidently married, and now doe feele the ſmart thereof, let them lay their hands to labour, and be the more painefull to get, to vphold their family, as <hi>Iacob</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 30.</note> did; and if they be godly and faithfull in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſeruice, God will bleſſe them, as he did him, in their meaſure, and as he in his diuine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall thinke meet for them. If we take the words as they be in the tranſlation, <hi>doe thou wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,</hi> let vs note that a man may bee ſaid to doe worthily in a double reſpect, either in reſpect of his perſon, when hee doth that which well befits him, according to his birth, his education, his age, his place, and his holy profeſſion of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, as men doe expect from ſuch a one; or in reſpect of the deed done, when it is ſo done, as the vertues, which ſhould concurre to the doing thereof, doe liuely appeare, and ſhew themſelues in it. To apply this to riches, in the getting, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and imployment of them, a man doth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, firſt, in the getting, when theſe vertues ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare; <hi>industry,</hi> painefully labouring, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, <hi>equity,</hi> in vſing onely lawfull meanes lawfully, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoiding all fraud, deceit, and vniuſt courſes to get riches: then <hi>pietie,</hi> which is a holy depending vpon God for a bleſſing vpon the lawfull meanes,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:1830:217"/> which he daily begges at his hands, not reſting vpon his owne wit, or paines-taking: and laſtly,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 5.</note>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in keeping, a man doth worthily, when therein is ſhewed <hi>frugalitie,</hi> a vertuous ſparing, and not a niggardly keeping in, vnbefitting his ability, his place and perſon; ſo alſo <hi>equitie</hi> euen in this, when he will not withhold from another, that vvhich is not his ovvne to keepe; for iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice may be as well in keeping, as in getting; and thirdly <hi>pietie,</hi> vvhich is, vvhen he ſets not his heart on riches, truſts not in them, nor is lifted vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his brethren, but knovveth himſelfe vnder God, in the midſt of his vvealth, vvalking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore religiouſly and humbly, this man ſo doing, doth vvorthily. Thirdly, in imploying or laying out, hee doth worthily, when hee is liberall to good vſes, for the good of Gods Church, as was <hi>Dauid,</hi> and his Princes; &amp; <hi>Salomon</hi> for the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; the Iſraelites before for the Tabernacle; and <hi>Hezechias</hi> and the people for the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites:<note place="margin">2.

                     <hi>And bee famous.</hi>] This well followeth after the other: They pray that he may doe worthily, and then become famous. <hi>It is a duety to pray one for another, eſpecially for men of authority, that they</hi>

                     <hi>may doe worthily, and become renowned thereby:</hi> for their greater authority, and becauſe their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of well-doing and fame therein will be a great meanes to perſwade others to wel-doing, or elſe a bridle to curb them for feare of offending: Let vs then pray for men in place to do worthily, and to become thereby renowned, to prouoke others to follow them, and that vertue may bee counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by them, as it will be by thoſe, which be famous for vertue. Note againe, that <hi>to doe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, procureth fame, and renowne, and good report:</hi> ſo <hi>Dauid</hi> became famous, and <hi>Salomon</hi> by his<note place="margin">2.

And this commeth to paſſe by the excellencie of well-doing in the minds of ſuch as loue it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, who cannot but in heart approue, and in tongue extoll it, and ſet forth the due praiſes of ſuch as doe worthily. The Lord alſo putteth this bleſſing vpon well-doing, that the Doers ſhall receiue honour and praiſe of men: ſo got <hi>Dauid</hi> praiſes euen aboue <hi>Saul,</hi> and was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">1.

                  <p>
                     <hi>In Bethlehem.</hi>] Heere is the place where they deſire to haue him famous, where he was brought vp, where hee had his meanes to liue, and place of authority; teaching heereby, that <hi>it is there chiefely required for a man to doe worthily, where he oweth that duety:</hi> as where he hath beene brought vp, where he hath his eſtate to liue by, and where God hath ſeated him. So did our Sauiour wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily<note place="margin">Luke 4. 16, 17, 18.</note> in Nazareth, <hi>Iephte</hi> among the Gileadites: for their good and the well-fare of all Iſrael, if <hi>Ephraim</hi> had ſo taken it. This is a memorandum to Miniſters, there to doe worthily, where God placeth them, and were they haue their liuing, and not bee like ſome that can doe worthily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad ſometimes, but at home will take little or no paines to teach their people. This alſo ſhould put Gentlemen and men of place, in mind to doe worthily in the countrey in good houſe-keeping among their Tenants, from whence they haue their reuenues; and not get vp to Cities, there to keepe a priuate table, to encreaſe their eſtate,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:1830:219"/> or elſe to vphold their pride.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Be like the houſe of Pharez.] Pharez</hi> ſignifieth a breach, becauſe in the wombe he ſtroue for the birth-right, and brake out before his brother <hi>Zarah,</hi> who had put out his hand to come firſt forth, to bee the firſt borne, but pluckt backe his hand againe. <hi>Zarah</hi> may ſet out the Iewes, who were the firſt of Gods people, but by apoſtaſie loſt their birth-right; <hi>Pharez</hi> may ſet out the Gentiles, who made a breach vpon them, and got the birth-right and the honour, to be called now the people of God. There bee two ſorts of <hi>Pharez,</hi> one heauenly, which ſtriue for to be of the firſt borne of God: this is a bleſſed ſtriuing which few contend for. There is another earthly, when brethren contend for to get the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inheritance from him, and doe labour to get him diſinherited: the neglect of the former, is vnholineſſe; and the purſuing of the latter, is too great worldlineſſe. Theſe words, <hi>To be like the houſe of Pharez,</hi> giue vs to know, that he was greatly bleſſed and honorable in his poſteritie, ſeeing they deſire that <hi>Boaz</hi> houſe might bee like his. Now men wiſh not ſuch a thing to great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but where there is an eſtate anſwerable to their greatneſſe, and may well befit them, and be held a bleſſing vnto them: and yet this <hi>Pharez</hi> was baſe gotten, and that in inceſt alſo. Whence wee may ſee, that <hi>baſely begotten may become very
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:1830:220"/> honorable,</hi> ſo as it may bee happy with others to be bleſſed like them for worldly reſpects. Thus alſo was <hi>Iephte</hi> honorable, a man of valor, made<note place="margin">Iud. 11.</note> the head ouer all the inhabitants of Gilead, and yet the ſonne of an Harlot. Thus it pleaſeth God to ſhew mercy on whom hee will ſhew mercy: which may comfort ſuch as be baſe borne, that if they bewaile their birth, and repent and beleeue, the Lord will haue mercy likewiſe on them, and regiſter them in the beadroll of the Saints, as <hi>Iephtah</hi> is. Againe, this may teach from theſe El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> and people, that <hi>they are to be esteemed hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, whom God doth make honorable;</hi> for theſe ſpeake highly of <hi>Pharez</hi> for all his birth; and the Gileadites thought worthily of <hi>Iephoah,</hi> and did him honor: yea, the holy Ghoſt hath vouchſafed to honor him, and to put him among the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, though hee was by birth a baſtard. They therefore doe amiſſe, who deſpiſe men for their birth, when otherwiſe they be worthily qualified, and better conditioned, then thoſe perhaps which be more lawfully begotten. True it is, that a Baſtard was not to come into the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ten generations, but God can diſpenſe with his Law, and where he ſo doth, let vs doe them honor, and not debaſe whom the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alteth.</p>

Note farther, how theſe words come in by a parentheſis: whether vttered by the Elders and people, or elſe put in by the Pen-man of the holy Ghoſt, it is not materiall: but heere we ſee, how God would haue a remembrance of the birth of <hi>Pharez,</hi> with his honour and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings from God: for <hi>that it is good in our great glory and outward proſperity, to be put in mind whence wee be.</hi> Thus God put <hi>Dauid</hi> in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance<note place="margin">2.

If the remembrance of the other put vs in minde of Gods mercy, much more this: for betweene them is no compariſon. Laſtly note, that it is ſaid, that <hi>Tamar</hi> bare <hi>Pharez vnto Iudah.

Note againe here, how this is ſpoken after marriage, and not before; to teach, that <hi>ſuch as be marryed, may lawfully company together:</hi> and that<note place="margin">Gen. 29. 21.</note> by warrant from God, who ſaid after hee had made man, and ioyned <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <hi>Increaſe and multiply:</hi> and the Apoſtle<note place="margin">1.

                     <hi>The Lord gaue her conception.</hi>] Hence it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>the gift of conception is from the Lord:</hi> and this is true not onely in ſuch as be altogether barren, as was <hi>Sarah, Rebecca, Hannah,</hi> the Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namite, and <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> but in ſuch as bee at the<note place="margin">Iob 10. 8, 10, 11.</note> firſt fruitfull; this alſo is from his gift. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it to be aſcribed to him, he is to be thanked for it; wee are not to thinke, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did, that a husband can giue children: it is no ſtrength of body, nor good complection that can make fruitfull, but the bleſſing of God. And wee may further learne here, that <hi>the Lord alloweth of the honest act of marriage:</hi> for hee commandeth due<note place="margin">1. Cor 7. Heb. 13. 4.</note> beneuolence: he calleth the marriage bed vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyled, hee bleſſeth it, and giueth the gift of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: hee allowed thereof before the fall, and<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 1. Cor. 7. 2.</note> hath in mercy ordained it as a remedy againſt ſinne. This therefore confuteth ſuch as haue iudged the companying together of man and wife to bee a ſinnefull act, abſurdly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely abuſing this place for it, <hi>Thoſe that liue in the fleſh, cannot pleaſe God:</hi> as if that which God himſelfe hath allowed, and moſt holy men of God haue done, ſhould bee now that, which
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:1830:226"/> ſhould debarre them of Gods fauour: when yet theſe popiſh harlotries can diſpence with Gods Law, and keepe their whores; and yet not liue in the fleſh, but bee holy men. But let them know, that whoremongers and adulterers God<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> will iudge: when marriage is honourable, and the bed vndefiled, and the libertie to be vſed and allowed for procreation of children, to auoid fornication, with heartie thankes vnto God for his ordinance. Heere note farther the difference which the Scripture maketh betweene concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a woman a wife, and of another. In co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation out of marriage, it is ſaid of a woman, that <hi>ſhee conceiued,</hi> as <hi>Thamar</hi> by <hi>Iudah, Hagar</hi> by<note place="margin">Gen. 38. 18. &amp; 16. 4. 2. Sam. 11. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Bathſheba</hi> by <hi>Dauid:</hi> but neuer as heere, that <hi>the Lord gaue her to conceiue:</hi> for the other is by his common bleſſing, as among bruit beaſts, but this by his fauourable approbation and gracious bleſſing, as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid of his children vnto <hi>Eſau.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 33. 5.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſhe bare a ſonne.</hi>] After the gift of concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, followeth child-birth, not forthwith, but in<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 10.</note> due time of life, which is ſometime at the nynth moneth, but commonly at the tenth. It was not enough that ſhe ſhould conceiue, and after haue an abortiue birth, but that God in mercy ſhould preſerue the child aliue in the mothers wombe to be timely borne: for as not to conceiue, but to be barren, was a puniſhment, ſo conceiuing, and to bring forth an vntimely birth, is in the ſame nature. The Lord therefore here ſheweth his goodneſſe, not onely in giuing conception, but a
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:1830:226"/> happy deliuerance vnto <hi>Ruth,</hi> and a timely birth; ſo the Lord followeth his with his mercies. Now in that it is ſaid to be a ſonne, and not a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is to note the greater bleſſing. For <hi>it is a greater bleſsing to haue a ſonne, then a daughter.</hi> And therefore wee doe finde, when God would make the barren to beare, and ſuch as had begged that bleſſing at his hands, he gaue them ſonnes, as we may ſee in <hi>Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Hannah, Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> and in others. Becauſe the ſonne is the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder of the name of the family, he is in nature the more worthy; for the woman was made for man, and not man for the woman, as the Apoſtle teacheth; and the man is a more fitter inſtrument for the good of the Church or Commonweale, albeit ſometime the Lord hath done wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly by women. Beſides theſe reaſons, the males among the Iſraelites were a greater bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; for that the man-child, and the continuance of the line in <hi>Iudah,</hi> gaue them hope of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, which they looked for; and the male child bare vpon him the ſeale of the couenant of God, which was circumciſion, that God would bee their God, and of their ſeed after them. Therefore praiſe God for this bleſſing and birth, for both, but more ſpecially for this, as beholding therein the Lords mercy to keepe thy name vpon the earth, among thy brethren, and Saints of God. Laſtly, note the effectuall power of the prayer which they made, verſ. 11. The Lord heard them; for here wee ſee <hi>Ruth</hi> before barren, is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fruitfull. So as we hereby doe learne, That
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:1830:227"/> 
                     <hi>the hearty and faithfull prayer of the godly is neuer in vaine:</hi> for the people and Elders deſired that <hi>Ruth</hi> ſhould be fruitfull, and ſhe was ſo, and alſo that <hi>Boaz</hi> poſterity might be honorable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, &amp; ſo it was, as we may ſee in the 21. and 22. verſes of this chapter. For an effectuall praier of righteous men auaileth much, as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 16, 17.</note> and prooueth by an inſtance of the prayer of <hi>Eliah,</hi> and as may be ſeene in the prayer of <hi>Moſes,</hi>

Secondly, that we haue aſſiſtance of God his Spirit, teaching vs to pray with groanes which cannot bee expreſſed; becauſe wee know not how to pray as wee ought: and thirdly, that Chriſt prayeth for vs, and in him we offer vp our ſupplications, and ſo ſhall be heard.

But out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperity ſo dazeleth the eyes, and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the heart, as the plagues of the ſoule, and vengeance due for the ſame, they either ſee not, or beleeue not; therefore they reioyce like worldlings with ſuch as themſelues.

Many things might mooue them hereto, and to be far from the behauiour of ſome, who in ſtead of praiſing God, ſit downe to bee merry, and to ſpend their ſpeeches idly, prating of others, yea, ſometimes in lewd ſlandering of their Neighbours, or in filthy ſcurrility, wherein the Midwife, which ſhould bee a mother of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, is often chiefe; when ſuch ſhould be chaſte, graue and godly matrons, who by their office and godly counſell might doe much good, if they were as they ought to bee; but ſo lewde are ſome of them, as they cannot endure the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of better diſpoſed perſons: Their praiſes ſhould bee like the Midwiues in Egypt, women<note place="margin">Exod. 1.</note> fearing God, able to inſtruct, to comfort, to pray vnto God, and to praiſe him for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                     <hi>Which hath not left thee this day without a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>] This is it they bleſſe God for; that God had giuen to <hi>Naomi</hi> a young kinſeman; a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man indeed, which will ſo ſhew himſelfe. <hi>Naomi</hi> had a kinſman very nigh vnto her before, Chap. 3. 12. but hee ſhewed himſelfe not like a kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and therefore was here paſſed ouer as no kinſman. For <hi>as men in deede ſhew themſelues, ſuch they bee, and ſo are to bee esteemed,</hi> otherwiſe they haue but a name of a Brother, Father, Kinſman, Friend, Chriſtian, yea, Miniſter, Magiſtrate, and haue not the trueth and ſubſtance of ſuch. They
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:1830:230"/> be but meerely titular, and glory in ſhadowes, as moſt doe, who are nothing anſwerable to that title and name of nature, of loue, of fellowſhip, or of office and place, which they are called by, or fettled in. Note further, that <hi>it is of God, that the godly poore are not left comfortles of ſome friend, one or other, both able and willing to helpe them.</hi> Thus the women here tell <hi>Naomi,</hi> and doe bleſſe God therefore in her behalfe; for if God ſhould not raiſe them vp ſuccour, who would reſpect them? Becauſe pouerty cauſeth contempt, or neglect at the leaſt, and the religion of the poore is but held counterfeit, and themſelues hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: ſo the world iudgeth of them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God raiſeth vp friends to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, and to doe them good, great cauſe haue they to bleſſe God, as they here doe, both for hope of ſupply of wants, and alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting of iniuries, which honeſt poore by ſuch able and good friends are leſſe ſubiect vnto, then others which want them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That his name may be famous in Iſrael.</hi>] This is the hope they haue of this young <hi>Obed;</hi> and one mercy of God, in giuing this Sonne vnto this honorable family, is, that he might be renowned among Gods people. Whence note theſe two leſſons: firſt, <hi>That much is expected and looked for from the children of great &amp; godly Parents,</hi> both in reſpect of the Parents, &amp; alſo of the Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For is it ſuppoſed, that Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts being godly, will haue care to inſtruct, and if need be, to correct their Children, to pray for them, and bee good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:1830:230"/> to them, and being great, that they will vſe the beſt meanes, and procure the beſt helps for their good education, and leaue them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſhew forth the fruits of godlineſſe. And if thus Parents doe, who may imagine otherwiſe, till the contrary appeare, but that the Children of ſuch will demeane themſelues as they ſhould? And who can expect but good from Children of godly Parents? Should not the Fathers graces prouoke Children to goodneſſe? and their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to abhorre baſe practices? Good Children will not degenerate from good Parents; whoſe goodneſſe will more perſwade to well-doing, then greatneſſe to make them proud and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as ſome <hi>Abſaloms</hi> and <hi>Eſaus</hi> haue beene, and yet are, to the griefe of religious Parents, and at length to the ſhame and confuſion of themſelues. Secondly, here may be obſerued, that <hi>God giueth Children to the better ſort, great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, that they may become famous amongst Gods people.</hi> So conceiued theſe godly women of this Sonne of <hi>Boaz;</hi> for, indeed, all the bleſſings of riches and honor giuen vnto Parents, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen for their owne good, but amongſt other ends, for the better inabling of them to bring vp their family in good order, and eſpecially their Children in the waies of God, for his ſeruice and honour, as they haue more meanes to prouoke them thereto. Let therefore ſuch Parents here take ſuch a courſe with their Children, as they may make them, by Gods bleſſing, famous in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, in Gods Church, and among his people;
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:1830:231"/> which they may effect by theſe good meanes. Firſt, by being euery way, and at all times a good example of piety to them, as <hi>Dauid</hi> was, and <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 101. Luk. 1.</note> Secondly, by inſtructing them carefully in godlineſſe and Religion, as Parents are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 4. Prou. 4.</note> and as <hi>Dauid</hi> did inſtruct <hi>Salomon.</hi> Thirdly, by ſeeing them ſet to the practice of that which they are taught, and to haue an eſpeciall eye thereto. Men teach their Children good manners among men, for ciuill carriage of their outward man, and will ſee therein if they offend, and reprooue them; ſo ſhould they thus ſee to them in their Chriſtian good manners and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour towards God and good men, and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Chriſtian duty towards all. Fourthly, by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them in ſome particular calling, as <hi>Adam</hi> the Monarch of the world did his ſonnes; to keepe them from idleneſſe, from being buſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies, and from a world of wickedneſſe, which ſuch as liue but of a calling runne into. Fifthly, by reſtraining them from ill company, idle, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, prodigall and prophane perſons, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to haue fellowſhip with ſuch as feare God, alſo with ciuill and honeſt men well repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, well brought vp, and well diſpoſed vnto goodneſſe. Sixthly, by commending, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing, and encouraging their well doing, both by preſent rewards and promiſes of future good: but if they doe ill, then fatherly to admoniſh at the firſt, to with-hold them from euill by loue, rather then by ſlauiſh feare; but if this will not preuaile, then to rebuke ſharpely, and to puniſh
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:1830:231"/> as the cauſe ſhall require. Thus if Parents would doe, there is no doubt, but by Gods mercy, many mens children of place, may become famous in Iſrael, and not be ſo infamous, as ſome be to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ſhame, and their owne ouerthrow.</p>

Thus let vs learne to trie the ſympathy of mens hearts towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in proſperitie and aduerſitie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arestorer of thy life.</hi>] So they ſpeake, as if by
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:1830:232"/> her former miſery ſhe had, as it were, been liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. Whence note; <hi>That heauy croſſes, as pouertie, old age, Widdowhood, and loſſe of Children, doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dead the ſpirit, euen of godly perſons.</hi> So theſe words imply, and experience teacheth. For no affliction is ioyous for the preſent, but grieuous, Heb. 12. 12. How much more when many come together? Therefore let vs haue compaſſion of the afflicted, and labour to raiſe vp their ſpirits, eſpecially of poore afflicted Widdowes; for it is a part of pure and vndefiled religion before God, Iam. 1. 27. This condemneth ſuch of cruelty, as will vexe the afflicted; or bee miſerable comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as <hi>Iobs</hi> friends were to him. Secondly, wee may learne, <hi>That godly Children are as restorers of life to their Parents,</hi> Prou. 10. 1. they make them glad. Let Children labour to be ſuch, that they may cheere vp their Parents hearts; and not bee as too many be, cauſers of hearts griefe to them, making them to goe downe with mourning to the graue; for ſuch are fooliſh Children, Prou. 15. 20. and 10. 1. and 17. 25.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And a nouriſher of thine old age.</hi>] Note, firſt, <hi>that old age needs nouriſhing:</hi> for it maketh man feeble, and to want heate, 1. King. 1. 1. Eccleſ. 12. 3. Alſo to be ſubiect to diſeaſes, as to bee blind, as was <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 27. and <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. 48. 10. &amp; to be lame, as <hi>Aſa,</hi> 1. King. 15. Therefore in the youth of Summer, prouide ſomewhat for the Winter of old age: and when thou haſt prouiſion for age, thanke God therefore. Secondly, <hi>that children are to be nouriſhers of their parents in their old age: as
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:1830:232"/> Ioſeph</hi> was to <hi>Iacob,</hi> Gen. 45. 11. and <hi>Ruth</hi> but a<note place="margin">See before Chap. 2. 18.</note> daughter in law here, to <hi>Naomi,</hi> Chap. 3. 18. and ſuch a one the women hoped <hi>Obed</hi> would be. Let children learne this duety: for firſt, nature teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, in the Storke; and branches of trees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the ſap from the roote, doe returne it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to it towards Winter. Secondly, Reaſon teacheth to bee thankefull, and to doe good to them that haue done vs good. From parents chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue being, bringing vp, and their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; whoſe <hi>loue, care, paines</hi> and <hi>cost,</hi> children can neuer recompence. Thirdly, it is one end why they bee borne: for if a friend bee borne to helpe his friend in aduerſitie, Prou. 17. 17. then much more children to helpe their parents, who are bone of their bone, and fleſh of their fleſh. Fourthly parents are childrens glory, Prou. 17. 6. Therfore ſhould they make much of them. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hereto adde the Commandement, Exod. 20. to honour our parents. Now, how are they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, when in want they are not relieued? Sixtly, ſuch as ſuccour their parents, may expect a bleſſing from their children. Thoſe children therefore which are without naturall affection, ſinne againſt God, againſt Nature, Reaſon and Religion. But children will, perhaps, ſay, Our parents are froward and hard to pleaſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make vs wearie and vnwilling to keepe and nouriſh them. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, conſider how froward you were in childhood, and yet poore parents carefully kept you, and caſt you not off. Secondly, when old age commeth, you may bee
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:1830:233"/> ſuch. Do then, as you would be done vnto: learne to beare with your parents, to teach your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren how to beare with you. Thirdly, note how children can beare with rich parents well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, while they hope for profit, and feare to loſe what they looke for. If hope of gaine can make children put on ſuch patience, then let true loue doe it much more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For thy daughter in law, which loueth thee, which is better then ſeuen ſonnes, hath borne him.</hi>] This is a reaſon of the womens hope of this childs kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards <hi>Naomi.</hi> From theſe words we may learne theſe things: Firſt, <hi>That there is good hope of childrens loue, which come of louing parents, that they will loue ſuch as their parents haue loued.</hi> Thus the women conclude: and this was a leſſon which <hi>Dauid</hi> taught his ſonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1. Kin. 2. 7. And Chriſt louing thoſe whom his Father loueth, teacheth ſo much. Let therefore children be thus affected, eſpecially if their parents haue ſet their loue aright, vpon ſuch as were worthy of loue. Secondly, <hi>That there may be great loue betweene a mother in law, and a daughter in law. Ruths</hi> loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Naomi</hi> was very great, ſhee left her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and kindred for her, Chap. 1. 16, 17. labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red painefully for her, Chap. 2. 18, 23. and <hi>Naomi</hi> was not wanting to ſeeke the good of <hi>Ruth,</hi> Cha. 3. Let theſe two bee examples to ſuch: and to make them louing, ſtriue to bee religious, and to feare God, as theſe did: for Religion will worke, what corrupt nature cannot effect. Let them performe mutuall dueties. And let ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:1830:233"/> know that they ſtep in, to be in ſtead of naturall mothers, and ſo let children take them; ſo will they loue one another. Thirdly, <hi>that true loue cannot be hid:</hi> for it ſo will expreſſe it ſelfe, as other ſhall take notice of it. Theſe women knew <hi>Ruths</hi> loue: ſo did <hi>Saul Ionathans</hi> to <hi>Dauid:</hi> the people Chriſts loue to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Iohn 11. 36. for true loue will breake out as fire. Try true loue by the manifeſtation thereof. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> may hide his a<note place="margin">Gen. 45. 1. 2. Sam. 13. 39. and 14. 1.</note> while from his brethren, and <hi>Dauid</hi> from <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> but it will breake out at length. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but boaſt vainely of loue; which neuer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it. Fourthly, <hi>that true loue in aduerſitie, is not lost in proſperity. Ruth</hi> is ſaid ſtill to loue <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omi,</hi> though thus exalted: ſo did <hi>Huſhai Dauid:</hi> ſo did <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, Chap. 2. howſoeuer they erred in iudgement. Let not loue be altered with our eſtates, nor honours change good conditions, as it doth in too many. Fifthly, <hi>that the loue of a ſtranger may ſometime exceed the loue of many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by nature.</hi> The women preferre <hi>Ruths</hi> loue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue ſeuen ſonnes, that is, aboue many ſonnes. Such God by fauour can ſupply, what is wanting in them by nature, and make a ſtrangers loue ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe. Let this be comfort to the diſtreſſed.</p>

                     <hi>And became his Nurſe.</hi>] That is, a helpe in the mothers nurſing of it, as by holding it, lulling of it aſleepe, giuing of it meat, warming of it, and ſuch like helps for the nouriſhing of the life of the Babe, and not giuing it ſucke, for ſhee was too old to doe this. Wee may find in Scripture two ſorts of Nurſes: dry Nurſes: ſuch a one was <hi>Rebeccaes,</hi> to helpe to attend on the childe, and<note place="margin">Gen. 24. 59.</note> to eaſe the mother ſomewhat, as <hi>Naomi</hi> doth here; and in helping to nouriſh and bring vp a child; in this ſenſe a father is called a Nurſe. The other ſort are milch-Nurſes, ſuch as giue ſuck<note place="margin">Num. 11. 12.</note> vnto children, as in Scripture we find onely thoſe to be their mothers, euen them that bare them, to bring them vp alſo, that as they afforded them the Wombe to beare them, ſo the breſts likewiſe to giue their children ſucke. And <hi>this is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers duety, if poſsibly ſhee be able:</hi> not birth, wealth, nicety, nor idleneſſe can exempt them from this duety; as it doth a number of wanton Dames, that they may be fitter to follow their luſts. <hi>That mothers are to giue their owne children ſucke:</hi> it is apparent by theſe reaſons: the naturall inſtinct in beaſts, teacheth euery other Creature hauing paps, to giue ſucke; yea, the Sea-monſters draw out their breſts, and giue ſucke to their young<note place="margin">Lamen. 4. 3.</note> ones, ſaith <hi>Ieremie:</hi> and therefore ſuch as neglect
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:1830:235"/> this duety, are worſe then theſe beaſts; which we hold vnkind, if they let not their young ones ſucke. It is the principall vſe and end of breſts in women, when God ſendeth them children, though too many now make them onely ſtales and bawdes of luſt. The Workemanſhip of God ſhould make them doe this: Firſt, in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them ſo high, as in no other creature, euen neighbouring vpon the heart, the Shop of heat, to conuey the bloud ſooner into the breſts; ſo as the heart workes for the Infant, to teach mothers to haue affection to this worke. Secondly, ſo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them, as the mother is taught in nature to embrace the Infant, to lay it to her breſt, the more to worke loue betweene the mother and the Babe. Thirdly, in making them to haue this facultie, to turne bloud into milke. And laſtly, Gods prouiding, as ſoone as the Infant is perfect for birth, milke in the breſt for the Infant: ſo as God and Nature call them to this duety, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept any will ſay that God hath done all this in vaine, and might haue ſpared this Workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The very name of a breſt, <hi>Mamma,</hi> ſhould put them in mind hereof, the firſt ſyllable where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is that which an Infant doth ſooneſt ſpeake, calling the mother <hi>Mam;</hi> as if nature had giuen this firſt to the Babe, ſo eaſily to frame to vtter this word, to put the mother in mind of her due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to giue it her breſt. Againe, God in the worke of nature hath not onely giuen breſts, but heads or nipples for the Infant to ſucke the milke out of the breſts; and to helpe it, hath made the
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:1830:236"/> ſkin about the nipples more rugous and rough for the childs tongue to hold by. The Heathen<note place="margin">Ariſt. &amp; Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch.</note> Philoſophers, endued but with the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, teach this, and affirme, that the mothers milke implants in children the loue of mothers; yea, mothers loue commonly thoſe children bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which they nurſe, than the reſt: and reaſon may bee giuen, becauſe the mother giueth, and the child receiueth, by ſucking her breſts, more of her ſubſtance, than they which doe not. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren loue their Nurſes, we ſee by experience, and better then their mothers that bare them, ſo long as they be without iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to diſcerne, &amp; onely follow nature, for the nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of life. It is not ſo naturall, ſay alſo theſe Heathen, to be nurſed of another, as of the mother, in whom it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: for differing bodies haue differing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, and therefore the taking away of the Infant ſo ſoone from the accuſtomed nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the mother, muſt needs breed an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A learned man thinkes this to be the cauſe<note place="margin">Kick. in his Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cono.</note> of the degenerating ſo much of Great mens ſonnes, and of their ſo little loue to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It is a token of no great loue to children, when their mothers put them ouer to ſtrangers, it is iuſt with God, if mothers after find their children ouer-ſtrange to them, being but rather<note place="margin">Note this, you vnnaturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> halfe than whole mothers, mothers of neceſſitie, &amp; not of good will: for perforce they bring forth: but it is true loue which maketh a mother to giue ſucke: ſafety to themſelues diſereth the former, or elſe to dye with it in the Wombe; but loue
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:1830:236"/> onely to the Infant, procureth this latter at their hands. Beſides all theſe reaſons, the examples of all the godly women in Scripture teach mothers now this duety. That right honourable <hi>Sarah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 21. 7.</note> the wife of a moſt honorable man, and mightie in ſubſtance and power, nurſed her ſonne <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Princely <hi>Iob</hi> was nouriſhed by the breſts of her<note place="margin">Iob 3. 12.

                     <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 23. Exod. 1. Iudg. 13. 42.</note> mother, and others? The mother of Ieſus our Lord and Sauiour, whom all doe honour, ſhee did giue her bleſſed Babe ſucke: all women call her bleſſed, becauſe ſhee bare Chriſt: And was ſhee not as bleſſed in giuing him her breſts to<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 27.</note> ſucke? Yes verily. Some good Ladies at this day diſdaine not this duety. And what ſhould hinder them? Such perſons may giue ſucke, and then may deliuer the child ouer to a dry Nurſe to attend it, in all other things, which helpe the poore cannot haue. Laſtly, as there is a bleſſing<note place="margin">Gen. 49. 25.</note> of the Wombe to bring forth, ſo of the breſts to<note place="margin">Hoſea 9. 14.</note> giue ſucke: and the dry breſts and barren wombe haue beene taken for a curſe. Let mothers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take knowledge of theſe things, to preſſe them to this duety of nurſing their owne bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, that in giuing ſtill of their owne ſubſtance, they might the more worke loue in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren towards them. Their excuſes are idle, &amp; are of no force againſt theſe reaſons: for true mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue is ſeene in nurſing: for luſt brings to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, neceſſity forceth to bring forth, but onely
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:1830:237"/> true and naturall loue cauſeth a mother to nurſe her child.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>There is a Sonne borne to Naomi.</hi>] That is, for the good and comfort of <hi>Naomi,</hi> as is before ſhewed out of the fifteenth verſe, and as may bee gathered by the like phraſe elſewhere. So as in<note place="margin">Eſai. 9. 6. Luk. 2. 11.</note> theſe words is a reaſon of the name which they gaue vnto the child. Whence note, that <hi>the godly in ancient time gaue names not by hap-hazard, but as good reaſon did leade them thereunto;</hi> for they gaue names in obedience to Gods commandement,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 19. &amp; 21. 3.

Sam. 4.</note> and <hi>Ichabod</hi> his. Some were named ſo from that which ſhould come to paſſe afterwards, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
                     <pb n="467" facs="tcp:1830:238"/> was, for that in his daies ſhould be reſt and<note place="margin">1. Chron. 22. 9.</note> peace. Some had their names from ſome things to be effected and done by them, ſo was our Lord called <hi>Ieſus,</hi> becauſe hee ſhould ſaue his people<note place="margin">Mat. 9.</note> from their ſinnes. Beſides theſe inducements to impoſe a name, they did ſometime call them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Anceſtors, to keepe them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 59, 61.</note> We muſt learne to imitate the holy men of God in theſe things; to expreſſe our own gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or to teach our children ſome duties, or to call to minde the workes of God, or to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber holy men and women to imitate their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. And we may not thinke this to be too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a practice, ſeeing Gods wiſdome interpoſed it ſelfe ſometime, both in giuing names, and in changing of names; and the reuerence due to the holy Sacrament adminiſtred, aduiſeth vs to a due conſideration hereof in honor of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And a good name may call ſometimes a man to the remembrance of his duty. I knowe that a name maketh not a man good: for ſome haue good names, but their conditions ſtarke naught: yet a good name may ſometime occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a man to thinke of goodneſſe; and howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the party ſo named doth make no vſe of it, yet it is commendable in the impoſers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who imitate the example of godly men in the old time, the Saints alſo in the Primitiue Church, and the godly-diſpoſed at this day. Which reprooueth ſuch as giue names idly without ſenſe or reaſon, ridiculous names, Heatheniſh rather then Chriſtian, and ſome

                  <p>
                     <hi>And they called his name Obed.</hi>] That is, as they gaue him his name, ſo thus was hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: which words may imply, that the name once giuen, was with authority confirmed ſo, as the Infant was commonly ſo called without alteration: neither were euer any names alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but vpon ſome extraordinary occaſion; for to ſuffer a change thereof, is either folly, or worſe, if good and honeſt cauſes mooue not thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obed.</hi>] This ſignifieth <hi>ſeruing,</hi> becauſe hee ſhould ſerue as a comforter to old <hi>Naomi,</hi> as the women ſaid, verſe 15. which is the reaſon of this name; to teach him, and alſo all <hi>Children</hi> their <hi>duetie,</hi> which is this, <hi>to labour to be a comfort vnto their Parents:</hi> of which before in verſe 15. Now this they ſhall doe, if they liue in obedience to their Parents, with feare to offend, yeelding euer to bee ruled by them: if they ſeeke to imitate their Parents vertues, and to follow them in all good things: if they frame their courſes to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, ſtriuing to haue an Heauenly Father alſo for their guide and direction: if they ſettle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to a good courſe of life, to liue within ſome honeſt calling, either in the Church or Common-wealth: if laſtly, they liue in mutuall loue one with another, like <hi>Iobs</hi> children. Theſe things will comfort Parents; which therefore let children labour for; let them bee <hi>Obeds,</hi> ſeruing thus to their comforts; let them bee
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:1830:239"/>

                  <p>Note here one thing more, before I come to the next words, how that this child is not called either <hi>Elimelech</hi> or <hi>Mahlon;</hi> and yet was he giuen to raiſe vp the name of the dead vpon his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that might not be cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place; and<note place="margin">Verſe 10.</note> for this end did <hi>Boaz</hi> marry <hi>Ruth.</hi> Whence therefore we may perceiue, that the preſeruation of the name of the dead ſtood not in anothers bearing of his name, ſo to be called, as he was; but rather in the iſſue hauing a right to the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance and inioying of it, that it might not bee alienated from the kindred and ſtocke of the dead: which being ſo, ſheweth the groſſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wrong which ſome ſhew to their neere blood, in diſinheriting daughters, and paſſing their inheritance vnto meere ſtrangers for a very bare name; as if that were to hold vp their name, when oftentimes it commeth to paſſe, that ſuch ſell away the inheritance, and ſo roote out their name, which is better kept by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing an inheritance in their blood and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, then by the ſound of a word vpon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a ſtranger: this folly we ſee by examples to be condemned and curſed before our eyes, in not a few.</p>

Secondly, that <hi>men hold themſelues honored to come of ſuch as haue gained honour in the world, though otherwiſe ſtained in their birth:</hi> for ſo here it is accounted hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to come of <hi>Pharez,</hi> as many with vs doe; to come but into this Iland, which <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> obtained, how baſe ſo euer he was by his birth: for outward honour and glory procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth eſtimation, and becloudeth birth ſo, as that no notice is taken thereof. Now, if outward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor effect this, with what honour may we thinke our ſelues honoured, when God, the Emperor of Heauen and earth, is willing to acknowledge vs to bee borne of him, and to bee called his Sonnes? But of this, few glory, becauſe it is onely ſpiritually diſcerned, and for that ſuch as bee ſo honoured with God, finde here many croſſes, and ſo are in contempt with the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded.</p>
                  <p>Now, in handling the reſt of the names, I will ſhew you out of them, that as one naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets another; ſo the Elect of God are to be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, one grace, as it were, producing another. The firſt in this naturall generation is <hi>Pharez,</hi>
                     <pb n="474" facs="tcp:1830:242"/> which ſignifieth <hi>ſeparate:</hi> ſo in the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall worke of Regeneration, the Elect muſt bee firſt <hi>Pharez,</hi> ſeparate by their effectuall calling by the Word, and by the holy Spirit in their conuerſation from the vaine world; for ſuch<note place="margin">2.

Such then as are companions with wicked, and ſo liue, they are no <hi>Pharezes,</hi> and ſo none of Chriſts line.</p>

                     <hi>Hezron begate Ram.</hi>] 1. Chron. 2. 9. Matth. 1.

The name ſignifieth <hi>high:</hi> for ſo are the Elect<note place="margin">Deut. 32. 10. Zach. 2. 8.</note> with God, and being once <hi>Hezrons,</hi> ioyfull in

Thus in the Line of Chriſt are brought in Gentiles, for our comfort, of whom he came, as well as of the Iewes; and is our kinſman, as well as theirs. This ſignifieth <hi>peaceable,</hi> and ſo are the Elect: for after they become <hi>Nahſhons,</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in Gods goodneſſe, they haue a peaceable conſcience, they haue a quiet minde, without murmuring, without doubting, without gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying the will of God in any thing, which may happen, though it croſſe them in this world neuer ſo much, they bee peaceable alſo towards others, becauſe the wiſedome from<note place="margin">Iames 3. 17.</note> aboue, with which they are indued, is peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

                     <hi>And Ieſse begate Dauid,</hi>] 1. Chron. 2. 13, 15. Mat. 1. Of this Kingly Prophet and propheticall King, I might ſpeake more at large, then might ſeeme ſutable to this briefe expoſition: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore referre you to the Bookes of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and the firſt of the Kings, and the firſt of the Chronicles, and to the Booke of Pſalmes, which liuely ſet out this holy man, a man after the Lords owne heart. His name ſignifieth <hi>beloued:</hi> and ſuch are the Lords Elect; and they may know themſelues to be ſo, God witneſſing his loue to them: for when they bee once <hi>Pharez,</hi> ſeparated from the vaine world; <hi>Hezrons,</hi> ioyfull and glad in this their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; <hi>Ram's,</hi> lifted vp in mind to heauenly things; <hi>Aminadabs,</hi> a free people from ſpirituall thraldome, hauing gotten the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Nahſhons,</hi> experienced in Gods loue; <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> peaceable; and <hi>Boazes,</hi> going on in this their ſtrength; and <hi>Obeds,</hi> obedient; and that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as <hi>Ieſses:</hi> what doubt is there, but that they bee <hi>Dauids,</hi> euen beloued of God?</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Chapter, and ſo this whole Hiſtory, we may here ſee, how <hi>from a meane estate,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:1830:244"/> ſome can ariſe to great honour:</hi> as <hi>Ruth</hi> from glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to be the wife of <hi>Boaz,</hi> and the Grand-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a King and Prophet. Thus poore <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi> was exalted, and that on a ſuddaine, from ſack-cloth into ſilken Robes fit for a King; from feare and danger of death, to great honor, and to be feared. And thus came <hi>Ioſeph</hi> from a priſon, to be a Prince in Egypt; and <hi>Dauid</hi> from keeping ſheepe, to bee the King of Iſrael: all which is the worke of God, as <hi>Hannah</hi> ſingeth, <hi>Dauid</hi> publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 8. Pſal. 75. 6, 7. &amp; 113. 7. Daniel. 4. 17.</note> and <hi>Daniel</hi> teacheth. It is eaſie with the Lord, ſuddainely to make a poore man rich, and to exalt him to honour. And therefore let ſuch as be low, not enuie the aduancement of others lifted vp; it is of God; and let them not repine, nor murmure to ſee themſelues neglected: for if God held it good for ſuch, and for his glory, to be lifted vp, as he can do it: ſo verily he would do it, as well as he doth others: for God reſpecteth no perſon, but doth what hee pleaſeth in heauen and in earth, &amp; what is moſt for his glory, though we iudge, perhaps, otherwiſe. Another thing may wee note for the comfort of the godly, <hi>That great is the reward of Religion. Ruth</hi> was of the Lord mercifully rewarded, as we haue heard; ſo was <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> by faith preſerued, and all with her, brought from among curſed Canaanites, to bee among the Iſraelites; yea, to become the wife of <hi>Salmon</hi> a Prince in Iſrael: and laſtly, to be vouchſafed this mercy, to bee recorded with the faithfull in the Catalogue of the moſt Renowned, yea, and to be mentioned with <hi>Abraham,</hi> for her good works,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note>
                     <pb n="479" facs="tcp:1830:244"/> the fruit of true faith. What got <hi>Dauid</hi> for his<note place="margin">Iam. 2.</note> vpright heart, though he ſeemed to be neglected of his parents, and ſent to keepe ſheepe, and not called to the Feaſt, till <hi>Samuel</hi> cauſed him to bee ſent for? Was not hee for all that, eſteemed of God, &amp; choſen before all his brethren? The Lord will not let goodneſſe be vnrewarded: for god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe hath the promiſe of this life, and of the Life to come. And in this, let all that truely feare God, comfort themſelues, and looke vp to the recompence of the reward, which in due time they ſhall receiue to the full, if they faint not. Bleſſed be God, and his Name be praiſed for euermore.</p>
