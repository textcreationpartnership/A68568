1. RVTHS Recompence: OR, A COMMENTARIE VPON THE BOOKE OF RVTH.

    _ CHAP. I.

      * Verſe 1. And it came to paſſe in the dayes when the Iudges ruled, that there was a famine in the Land, and a certaine man of Bethlehem Iudah went to ſoiourne in the Countrey of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two ſonnes.

      * Verſe 2. And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two ſonnes, Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Iudah: and they came into the countrey of Moah, and continued there.

      * Verſ. 3. And Elimelech Naomies husband dyed, and ſhee was left, and her two ſonnes.

      * Verſ. 4. And they tooke them wiues of the women of Moab, the name of the one was Orpha, and the name of the other Ruth, and they dwelled there about tenne yeeres.

      * Verſe 5. And Mahlon and Chilion dyed alſo both of them, and the woman was left of her two ſonnes, and of her husband.

      * Verſe. 6. Then ſhe aroſe with her daughters in law, that ſhee might returne from the Countrey of Moab: for ſhee had heard in the Countrey of Moab, how that the Lord had viſited his people in giuing them bread.

      * Verſe 7. Wherefore ſhee went forth out of the place where ſhee was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on their way to returne vnto the Land of Iudah.

      * Verſe 8. And Naomi ſaid vnto her two daughters in law, Goe, returne each to her mothers houſe: the Lord deale kindly with you, as you haue dealt with the dead and with me.

      * Verſe 9. The Lord grant you, that you may find reſt each of you in the houſe of her husband. Then ſhe kiſſed them, and they lift vp their voice and wept.

      * Verſe 10. And they ſaid vnto her, Surely wee will returne with thee vnto thy people.

      * Verſe 11. And Naomi ſaid, Turne againe, my daughters: Why will you goe with me? Are there yet more ſonnes in my wombe, that they may bee your husbands?

      * Verſe 12. Turne againe, my daughters, goe your way, for I am too old to haue an husband: if I ſhould ſay, I haue hope, if I ſhould haue an husband alſo to night, and ſhould alſo beare ſonnes:

      * Verſe 13. Would yee tarry for them, till they were growne? would yee ſtay for them from hauing husbands? nay, my daughters: for it grieueth me much for your ſakes, that the hand of the Lord is gone out againſt me.

      * Verſe 14. And they lift vp their voice and wept againe: and Orpha kiſſed her mother in law, but Ruth claue vnto her.

      * Verſe 15. And ſhee ſaid, Behold, thy ſiſter in law is gone backe vnto her people, and vnto her gods: returne thou after thy ſiſter in law.

      * Verſe 16. And Ruth ſaid, Intreat me not to leaue thee, or to returne from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will goe, and where thou lodgeſt, I will lodge: thy people ſhall be my people, and thy God, my God.

      * Verſe 17. Where thou dieſt, will I die, and there will I be buried; the Lord doe ſo to me and more alſo, if ought but death part thee and mee.

      * Verſe. 18. When ſhee ſaw that ſhee was ſtedfaſtly minded to goe with her, then ſhe left off ſpeaking vnto her.

      * Verſe 19. So they two went vntill they came to Bethlehem: and it came to paſſe, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the Citie was moued about them, and they ſaid, Is this Naomi?

      * Verſe 20. And ſhee ſaid vnto them, Call mee not Naomi; call me Marah: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

      * Verſe 21. I went out full, and the Lord hath brought me home againe empty: Why then call ye me Naomi, ſeeing the Lord hath teſtified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?

      * Verſe 22. So Naomi returned; and Ruth the Moabiteſſe her daughter in law with her, which returned out of the Countrey of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of Barley harueſt.

      * Verſe 1. And Naomi had a kinſman of her huſbands, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.

      * Verſe 2. And Ruth the Moabiteſſe ſaid vnto Naomi, Let me now goe to the field, and gleane eares of corne after him, in whoſe ſight I ſhall find grace. And ſhee ſaid vnto her, Goe, my daughter.

      * Verſe 3. And ſhee went, and came and gleaned in the field after the Reapers; and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

      * Verſe. 4. And behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and ſaid vnto the Reapers, The Lord bee with you. And they anſwered him, The Lord bleſſe thee.

      * Verſe 5. Then ſaid Boaz vnto his ſeruant, that was ſet ouer the Reapers, Whoſe Damoſell is this?

      * Verſe 6. And the ſeruant that was ſet ouer the Reapers, anſwered & ſaid, It is the Moabiteſſe damoſell that came backe with Naomi out of the countrey of Moab.

      * Verſe 7. And ſhee ſaid, I pray you, let me gleane and gather after the Reapers, amongst the ſheaues: ſo ſhe came, and hath continued euen from the morning, vntill now, that ſhee tarried a little in the houſe.

      * Verſe 8. Then ſaid Boaz vnto Ruth, Heareſt thou not, my daughter? Goe not to gleane in another field, neither goe from hence, but abide here faſt by my maidens.

      * Verſe 9. Let thine eyes be on the field that they doe reape, and goe thou after them: Haue not I charged the yong men, that they ſhould not touch thee? And when thou art a thirſt, goe vnto the veſſels, and drinke of that which the yong men haue drawne.

      * Verſe 10. Then ſhe fell on her face, and bowed her ſelfe to the ground, and ſaid vnto him, Why haue I found grace in thine eyes, that thou ſhouldest take knowledge of me, ſeeing I am a ſtranger?

      * Verſe 11. And Boaz anſwered and ſaid vnto her, It hath fully beene ſhewed me, all that thou haſt done vnto thy mother in law, ſince the death of thine huſband; and how thou haſt left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy natiuity, and art come vnto a people, which thou kneweſt not heretofore.

      * Verſe 12. The Lord recompence thy worke, and a full reward be giuen thee of the Lord God of Iſrael, vnder whoſe wings thou art come to truſt.

      * Verſe 13. Then ſhe ſaid, Let me find fauour in thy ſight, my Lord, for thou hast comforted mee, and for that thou haſt ſpoken friendly vnto thine hand-maid, though I be not like vnto one of thine hand-maidens.

      * Verſe 14. And Boaz ſaid vnto her, At meale time come thou hither, and eate of the bread, and dip thy morſell in the vineger. And ſhee ſate beſides the Reapers: and he reached her parched corne, and ſhee did eate, and was ſufficed, and left.

      * Verſ. 15. And when ſhe was riſen vp to gleane,
 Boaz commanded his yong men, ſaying, Let her gleane euen among the ſheaues, and reproach her not.

      * Verſ. 16. And let fall alſo ſome of the handfuls of purpoſe for her, and leaue them, that ſhe may gleane them, and rebuke her not.

      * Verſ. 17. So ſhe gleaned in the field vntill euen, and beat out that ſhe had gleaned; and it was about an Epha of Barley.

      * Verſ. 18. And ſhee tooke it vp, and went into the citie; and her mother in law ſaw what ſhee had gleaned; and ſhe brought forth, and gaue to her that ſhee had reſerued, after ſhe was ſufficed.

      * Verſe 19. And her mother in law ſaid vnto her, Where haſt thou gleaned to day? and where wroughteſt thou? Bleſſed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And ſhee ſhewed her mother in law, with whom ſhee had wrought, and ſaid, The mans name with whom I wrought to day, is Boaz.

      * Verſe 20. And Naomi ſaid vnto her daughter in law, Bleſsed be he of the Lord, who hath not left off his kindneſse to the liuing & to the dead. And Naomi ſaid vnto her, The man is neere of kinne vnto vs, one of our next kinſmen.

      * Verſe 21. And Ruth the Moabiteſse ſaid, He ſaid vnto me alſo, Thou ſhalt keepe faſt by my yong men, vntill they haue ended all my harueſt.

      * Verſe 22. And Naomi ſaid vnto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou goe out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in another field.

      * Verſe 23. So ſhee kept faſt by the maidens of Boaz to gleane, vnto the end of Barley harueſt and of Wheat haruest, and dwelt with her mother in law.

      * Verſe 1. Then Naomi, her mother in law, ſaid vnto her, My daughter, ſhall I not ſeeke reſt for thee, that it may be well with thee?

      * Verſe 2. And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whoſe maidens thou waſt? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threſhing-floore.

      * Verſe 3. Waſh thy ſelfe therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment vpon thee, and get thee downe to the floore: but make not thy ſelfe knowne to the man, vntill he ſhall haue done eating and drinking.

      * Verſe 4. And it ſhall be when he lyeth downe, thou ſhalt marke the place where he ſhall lye, and thou ſhalt goe in, and vncouer his feet, and lay thee downe, and he will tell thee what thou ſhalt doe.

      * Verſe 5. And ſhee ſaid vnto her, All that thou ſayest vnto mee, I will doe.

      * Verſe 6. And ſhee went downe vnto the floore, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.

      * Verſe 7. And when Boaz had eaten and drunken, and his heart was merry, he went to lye downe at the end of the heape of corne: and ſhee came ſoftly, and vncouered his feet, and laid her downe.

      * Verſe 8. And it came to paſſe at mid-night, that the man was afraid, and turned himſelfe; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.

      * Verſe 9. And he ſaid, Who art thou? And ſhee anſwered, I am Ruth thine handmaid; ſpread therefore thy skirt ouer thine handmaid, for thou art a neere kinſman.

      * Verſe 10. And hee ſaid, Bleſſed be thou of the Lord, my daughter: for thou haſt ſhewed more kindneſſe in the latter end, then at the beginning, in as much as thou followeſt not young men, whether poore or rich.

      * Verſe 11. And now, my daughter, feare not, I will doe to thee all thou requireſt: for all the Citie of my people doth know, that thou art a vertuous woman.

      * Verſe 12. And now it is true, that I am thy neere kinſman: howbeit, there is a kinſman neerer then I.

      * Verſe 13. Tarry this night, and it ſhall be in the morning, that if hee will performe vnto thee the part of a kinſman, well, let him doe the kinſmans part: but if hee will not doe the part of a kinſman to thee, then will I doe the part of a kinſman to thee, as the Lord liueth: lie downe vntill the morning.

      * Verſe 14. And ſhee lay at his feet vntill the morning: and ſhee roſe vp before one could know another: for hee ſaid, Let it not bee knowne, that a woman came into the floore.

      * Verſe 15. Alſo hee ſaid, Bring the vaile that thou hast vpon thee, and hold it. And when ſhee held it, hee meaſured ſix meaſures of Barley, and laid it on her: and ſhee went into the Citie.

      * Verſe 16. And when ſhee came to her mother in law, ſhee ſaid, Who art thou, my daughter? And ſhe told her all that the man had done vnto her.

      * Verſe 17. And ſhee ſaid, Theſe ſixe meaſures of Barley gaue hee mee: for hee ſaid to mee, Goe not emptie vnto thy mother in law.

      * Verſe 18. Then ſaid ſhee, Sit ſtill, my daughter, vntill thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not bee in rest, vntill hee haue finiſhed the thing this day.

      * Verſe 1. Then Boaz went vp to the gate, and ſate him downe there: and behold, the kinſman of whom Boaz ſpake, came by, vnto whom he ſaid, Ho, ſuch a one: turne aſide, ſit downe heere. And he turned aſide and ſate downe.

      * Verſe 2. And hee tooke ten men of the Elders of the Citie, and ſaid, Sit yee downe heere. And they ſate downe.

      * Verſe 3. And hee ſaid vnto the kinſman, Naomi that is come againe out of the countrey of Moab, ſelleth a parcell of land which was our brother Elimelechs.

      * Verſe 4. And I thought to aduertiſe thee, ſaying, Buy it before the Inhabitants, and before the Elders of my people. If thou wilt redeeme it, redeeme it; but if thou wilt not redeeme it, then tell me that I may know: for there is none to redeeme it, beſides thee, and I am after thee. And hee ſaid, I will redeeme it.

      * Verſe 5. Then ſaid Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it alſo of Ruth the Moabiteſse, the wife of the dead, to raiſe vp the name of the dead vpon his inheritance.

      * Verſe 6. And the Kinſman ſaid, I cannot redeeme it for my ſelfe; lest I marre mine owne inheritance: redeeme thou my right to thy ſelfe: for I cannot redeeme it.

      * Verſe 7. Now this was the manner in former time in Iſrael, concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirme all things: a man plucked off his ſhoo, and gaue it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Iſrael.

      * Verſe 8. Therefore the kinſman ſaid vnto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his ſhoo.

      * Verſe 9. And Boaz ſaid vnto the Elders, and vnto all the people, Yee are witneſses this day▪ that I haue bought all that was Elimelechs, and all that was Chilions and Mahlons, of the hand of Naomi.

      * Verſe 10. Moreouer, Ruth the Moabiteſse, the wife of Mahlon, haue I purchaſed to be• my wife, to raiſe vp the name of the dead vpon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: yee are witneſses this day.

      * Verſe 11. And all the people that were in the Gate, and the Elders ſaid, We are witneſses: The Lord make the woman that is come into thine houſe, like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the houſe of Iſrael: And doe thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem.

      * Verſe 12. And let thy houſe bee like the houſe of Pharez (whom Tamar bare vnto Iudah) of the ſeed, which the Lord ſhall giue thee, of this young woman.

      * Verſe 13. So Boaz tooke Ruth, and ſhee was his wife: And when hee went in vnto her, the Lord gaue her conception, and ſhee bare a ſonne.

      * Verſe 14. And the women ſaid vnto Naomi, Bleſſed be the Lord, which hath not left thee this day without a kinſman, that his name may bee famous in Iſrael.

      * Verſe 15. And he ſhall be vnto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nouriſher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loueth thee, which is better to thee thenſeuen ſonnes, hath borne him.

      * Verſe 16. And Naomi tooke the child, and laid it in her boſome, and became nurſe vnto it.

      * Verſe 17. And the women her Neighbours gaue it a name, ſaying, There is a ſonne borne to Naomi: and they called his name Obed; he is the Father of leſſe, the Father of Dauid.

      * Verſe 18. Now theſe are the generations of Pharez; Pharez begat Ram.

    _ CHAP. II.

      * Verſe 1. And it came to paſſe in the dayes when the Iudges ruled, that there was a famine in the Land, and a certaine man of Bethlehem Iudah went to ſoiourne in the Countrey of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two ſonnes.

      * Verſe 2. And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two ſonnes, Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem Iudah: and they came into the countrey of Moah, and continued there.

      * Verſ. 3. And Elimelech Naomies husband dyed, and ſhee was left, and her two ſonnes.

      * Verſ. 4. And they tooke them wiues of the women of Moab, the name of the one was Orpha, and the name of the other Ruth, and they dwelled there about tenne yeeres.

      * Verſe 5. And Mahlon and Chilion dyed alſo both of them, and the woman was left of her two ſonnes, and of her husband.

      * Verſe. 6. Then ſhe aroſe with her daughters in law, that ſhee might returne from the Countrey of Moab: for ſhee had heard in the Countrey of Moab, how that the Lord had viſited his people in giuing them bread.

      * Verſe 8. And Naomi ſaid vnto her two daughters in law, Goe, returne each to her mothers houſe: the Lord deale kindly with you, as you haue dealt with the dead and with me.

      * Verſe 9. The Lord grant you, that you may find reſt each of you in the houſe of her husband. Then ſhe kiſſed them, and they lift vp their voice and wept.

      * Verſe 14. And they lift vp their voice and wept againe: and Orpha kiſſed her mother in law, but Ruth claue vnto her.

      * Verſe 15. And ſhee ſaid, Behold, thy ſiſter in law is gone backe vnto her people, and vnto her gods: returne thou after thy ſiſter in law.

      * Verſe 16. And Ruth ſaid, Intreat me not to leaue thee, or to returne from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will goe, and where thou lodgeſt, I will lodge: thy people ſhall be my people, and thy God, my God.

      * Verſe 17. Where thou dieſt, will I die, and there will I be buried; the Lord doe ſo to me and more alſo, if ought but death part thee and mee.

      * Verſe 12. And now it is true, that I am thy neere kinſman: howbeit, there is a kinſman neerer then I.

      * Verſe 1. Then Boaz went vp to the gate, and ſate him downe there: and behold, the kinſman of whom Boaz ſpake, came by, vnto whom he ſaid, Ho, ſuch a one: turne aſide, ſit downe heere. And he turned aſide and ſate downe.

      * Verſe 2. And hee tooke ten men of the Elders of the Citie, and ſaid, Sit yee downe heere. And they ſate downe.

      * Verſe 3. And hee ſaid vnto the kinſman, Naomi that is come againe out of the countrey of Moab, ſelleth a parcell of land which was our brother Elimelechs.

      * Verſe 4. And I thought to aduertiſe thee, ſaying, Buy it before the Inhabitants, and before the Elders of my people. If thou wilt redeeme it, redeeme it; but if thou wilt not redeeme it, then tell me that I may know: for there is none to redeeme it, beſides thee, and I am after thee. And hee ſaid, I will redeeme it.

      * Verſe 5. Then ſaid Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it alſo of Ruth the Moabiteſse, the wife of the dead, to raiſe vp the name of the dead vpon his inheritance.

      * Verſe 6. And the Kinſman ſaid, I cannot redeeme it for my ſelfe; lest I marre mine owne inheritance: redeeme thou my right to thy ſelfe: for I cannot redeeme it.

      * Verſe 7. Now this was the manner in former time in Iſrael, concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirme all things: a man plucked off his ſhoo, and gaue it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Iſrael.

      * Verſe 8. Therefore the kinſman ſaid vnto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his ſhoo.

      * Verſe 9. And Boaz ſaid vnto the Elders, and vnto all the people, Yee are witneſses this day▪ that I haue bought all that was Elimelechs, and all that was Chilions and Mahlons, of the hand of Naomi.

      * Verſe 10. Moreouer, Ruth the Moabiteſse, the wife of Mahlon, haue I purchaſed to be• my wife, to raiſe vp the name of the dead vpon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: yee are witneſses this day.

      * Verſe 11. And all the people that were in the Gate, and the Elders ſaid, We are witneſses: The Lord make the woman that is come into thine houſe, like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the houſe of Iſrael: And doe thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem.

      * Verſe 12. And let thy houſe bee like the houſe of Pharez (whom Tamar bare vnto Iudah) of the ſeed, which the Lord ſhall giue thee, of this young woman.

      * Verſe 13. So Boaz tooke Ruth, and ſhee was his wife: And when hee went in vnto her, the Lord gaue her conception, and ſhee bare a ſonne.

      * Verſe 14. And the women ſaid vnto Naomi, Bleſſed be the Lord, which hath not left thee this day without a kinſman, that his name may bee famous in Iſrael.

      * Verſe 15. And he ſhall be vnto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nouriſher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loueth thee, which is better to thee thenſeuen ſonnes, hath borne him.

      * Verſe 16. And Naomi tooke the child, and laid it in her boſome, and became nurſe vnto it.

      * Verſe 17. And the women her Neighbours gaue it a name, ſaying, There is a ſonne borne to Naomi: and they called his name Obed; he is the Father of leſſe, the Father of Dauid.

      * Verſe 5. And Mahlon and Chilion dyed alſo both of them, and the woman was left of her two ſonnes, and of her husband.

      * Verſe. 6. Then ſhe aroſe with her daughters in law, that ſhee might returne from the Countrey of Moab: for ſhee had heard in the Countrey of Moab, how that the Lord had viſited his people in giuing them bread.

      * Verſe 7. Wherefore ſhee went forth out of the place where ſhee was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on their way to returne vnto the Land of Iudah.

      * Verſe 10. And they ſaid vnto her, Surely wee will returne with thee vnto thy people.

      * Verſe 11. And Naomi ſaid, Turne againe, my daughters: Why will you goe with me? Are there yet more ſonnes in my wombe, that they may bee your husbands?

      * Verſe 12. Turne againe, my daughters, goe your way, for I am too old to haue an husband: if I ſhould ſay, I haue hope, if I ſhould haue an husband alſo to night, and ſhould alſo beare ſonnes:

      * Verſe 1. And Naomi had a kinſman of her huſbands, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.

      * Verſe 10. Then ſhe fell on her face, and bowed her ſelfe to the ground, and ſaid vnto him, Why haue I found grace in thine eyes, that thou ſhouldest take knowledge of me, ſeeing I am a ſtranger?

      * Verſe 11. And Boaz anſwered and ſaid vnto her, It hath fully beene ſhewed me, all that thou haſt done vnto thy mother in law, ſince the death of thine huſband; and how thou haſt left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy natiuity, and art come vnto a people, which thou kneweſt not heretofore.

      * Verſe 14. And Boaz ſaid vnto her, At meale time come thou hither, and eate of the bread, and dip thy morſell in the vineger. And ſhee ſate beſides the Reapers: and he reached her parched corne, and ſhee did eate, and was ſufficed, and left.

      * Verſ. 15. And when ſhe was riſen vp to gleane,
 Boaz commanded his yong men, ſaying, Let her gleane euen among the ſheaues, and reproach her not.

      * Verſ. 16. And let fall alſo ſome of the handfuls of purpoſe for her, and leaue them, that ſhe may gleane them, and rebuke her not.

      * Verſ. 17. So ſhe gleaned in the field vntill euen, and beat out that ſhe had gleaned; and it was about an Epha of Barley.

      * Verſ. 18. And ſhee tooke it vp, and went into the citie; and her mother in law ſaw what ſhee had gleaned; and ſhe brought forth, and gaue to her that ſhee had reſerued, after ſhe was ſufficed.

      * Verſe 19. And her mother in law ſaid vnto her, Where haſt thou gleaned to day? and where wroughteſt thou? Bleſſed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And ſhee ſhewed her mother in law, with whom ſhee had wrought, and ſaid, The mans name with whom I wrought to day, is Boaz.

      * Verſe 7. And ſhee ſaid, I pray you, let me gleane and gather after the Reapers, amongst the ſheaues: ſo ſhe came, and hath continued euen from the morning, vntill now, that ſhee tarried a little in the houſe.

      * Verſe 8. Then ſaid Boaz vnto Ruth, Heareſt thou not, my daughter? Goe not to gleane in another field, neither goe from hence, but abide here faſt by my maidens.

      * Verſe 9. Let thine eyes be on the field that they doe reape, and goe thou after them: Haue not I charged the yong men, that they ſhould not touch thee? And when thou art a thirſt, goe vnto the veſſels, and drinke of that which the yong men haue drawne.

      * Verſe 10. Then ſhe fell on her face, and bowed her ſelfe to the ground, and ſaid vnto him, Why haue I found grace in thine eyes, that thou ſhouldest take knowledge of me, ſeeing I am a ſtranger?

      * Verſe 11. And Boaz anſwered and ſaid vnto her, It hath fully beene ſhewed me, all that thou haſt done vnto thy mother in law, ſince the death of thine huſband; and how thou haſt left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy natiuity, and art come vnto a people, which thou kneweſt not heretofore.

      * Verſe 12. The Lord recompence thy worke, and a full reward be giuen thee of the Lord God of Iſrael, vnder whoſe wings thou art come to truſt.

      * Verſe 13. Then ſhe ſaid, Let me find fauour in thy ſight, my Lord, for thou hast comforted mee, and for that thou haſt ſpoken friendly vnto thine hand-maid, though I be not like vnto one of thine hand-maidens.

      * Verſe 14. And Boaz ſaid vnto her, At meale time come thou hither, and eate of the bread, and dip thy morſell in the vineger. And ſhee ſate beſides the Reapers: and he reached her parched corne, and ſhee did eate, and was ſufficed, and left.

      * Verſ. 15. And when ſhe was riſen vp to gleane,
 Boaz commanded his yong men, ſaying, Let her gleane euen among the ſheaues, and reproach her not.

      * Verſ. 16. And let fall alſo ſome of the handfuls of purpoſe for her, and leaue them, that ſhe may gleane them, and rebuke her not.

      * Verſ. 17. So ſhe gleaned in the field vntill euen, and beat out that ſhe had gleaned; and it was about an Epha of Barley.

      * Verſ. 18. And ſhee tooke it vp, and went into the citie; and her mother in law ſaw what ſhee had gleaned; and ſhe brought forth, and gaue to her that ſhee had reſerued, after ſhe was ſufficed.

      * Verſe 19. And her mother in law ſaid vnto her, Where haſt thou gleaned to day? and where wroughteſt thou? Bleſſed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And ſhee ſhewed her mother in law, with whom ſhee had wrought, and ſaid, The mans name with whom I wrought to day, is Boaz.

      * Verſe 20. And Naomi ſaid vnto her daughter in law, Bleſsed be he of the Lord, who hath not left off his kindneſse to the liuing & to the dead. And Naomi ſaid vnto her, The man is neere of kinne vnto vs, one of our next kinſmen.

      * Verſe 21. And Ruth the Moabiteſse ſaid, He ſaid vnto me alſo, Thou ſhalt keepe faſt by my yong men, vntill they haue ended all my harueſt.

      * Verſe 22. And Naomi ſaid vnto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my daughter, that thou goe out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in another field.

      * Verſe 23. So ſhee kept faſt by the maidens of Boaz to gleane, vnto the end of Barley harueſt and of Wheat haruest, and dwelt with her mother in law.

      * Verſe 1. Then Naomi, her mother in law, ſaid vnto her, My daughter, ſhall I not ſeeke reſt for thee, that it may be well with thee?

      * Verſe 2. And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whoſe maidens thou waſt? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threſhing-floore.

      * Verſe 3. Waſh thy ſelfe therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment vpon thee, and get thee downe to the floore: but make not thy ſelfe knowne to the man, vntill he ſhall haue done eating and drinking.

      * Verſe 4. And it ſhall be when he lyeth downe, thou ſhalt marke the place where he ſhall lye, and thou ſhalt goe in, and vncouer his feet, and lay thee downe, and he will tell thee what thou ſhalt doe.

      * Verſe 5. And ſhee ſaid vnto her, All that thou ſayest vnto mee, I will doe.

      * Verſe 6. And ſhee went downe vnto the floore, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her.

      * Verſe 7. And when Boaz had eaten and drunken, and his heart was merry, he went to lye downe at the end of the heape of corne: and ſhee came ſoftly, and vncouered his feet, and laid her downe.

      * Verſe 8. And it came to paſſe at mid-night, that the man was afraid, and turned himſelfe; and behold, a woman lay at his feet.

      * Verſe 9. And he ſaid, Who art thou? And ſhee anſwered, I am Ruth thine handmaid; ſpread therefore thy skirt ouer thine handmaid, for thou art a neere kinſman.

      * Verſe 10. And hee ſaid, Bleſſed be thou of the Lord, my daughter: for thou haſt ſhewed more kindneſſe in the latter end, then at the beginning, in as much as thou followeſt not young men, whether poore or rich.

      * Verſe 11. And now, my daughter, feare not, I will doe to thee all thou requireſt: for all the Citie of my people doth know, that thou art a vertuous woman.

      * Verſe 12. And now it is true, that I am thy neere kinſman: howbeit, there is a kinſman neerer then I.

      * Verſe 13. Tarry this night, and it ſhall be in the morning, that if hee will performe vnto thee the part of a kinſman, well, let him doe the kinſmans part: but if hee will not doe the part of a kinſman to thee, then will I doe the part of a kinſman to thee, as the Lord liueth: lie downe vntill the morning.

      * Verſe 14. And ſhee lay at his feet vntill the morning: and ſhee roſe vp before one could know another: for hee ſaid, Let it not bee knowne, that a woman came into the floore.

      * Verſe 15. Alſo hee ſaid, Bring the vaile that thou hast vpon thee, and hold it. And when ſhee held it, hee meaſured ſix meaſures of Barley, and laid it on her: and ſhee went into the Citie.

      * Verſe 16. And when ſhee came to her mother in law, ſhee ſaid, Who art thou, my daughter? And ſhe told her all that the man had done vnto her.

      * Verſe 17. And ſhee ſaid, Theſe ſixe meaſures of Barley gaue hee mee: for hee ſaid to mee, Goe not emptie vnto thy mother in law.

      * Verſe 18. Then ſaid ſhee, Sit ſtill, my daughter, vntill thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not bee in rest, vntill hee haue finiſhed the thing this day.

      * Verſe 1. Then Boaz went vp to the gate, and ſate him downe there: and behold, the kinſman of whom Boaz ſpake, came by, vnto whom he ſaid, Ho, ſuch a one: turne aſide, ſit downe heere. And he turned aſide and ſate downe.

      * Verſe 2. And hee tooke ten men of the Elders of the Citie, and ſaid, Sit yee downe heere. And they ſate downe.

      * Verſe 3. And hee ſaid vnto the kinſman, Naomi that is come againe out of the countrey of Moab, ſelleth a parcell of land which was our brother Elimelechs.

      * Verſe 4. And I thought to aduertiſe thee, ſaying, Buy it before the Inhabitants, and before the Elders of my people. If thou wilt redeeme it, redeeme it; but if thou wilt not redeeme it, then tell me that I may know: for there is none to redeeme it, beſides thee, and I am after thee. And hee ſaid, I will redeeme it.

      * Verſe 5. Then ſaid Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it alſo of Ruth the Moabiteſse, the wife of the dead, to raiſe vp the name of the dead vpon his inheritance.

      * Verſe 6. And the Kinſman ſaid, I cannot redeeme it for my ſelfe; lest I marre mine owne inheritance: redeeme thou my right to thy ſelfe: for I cannot redeeme it.

      * Verſe 7. Now this was the manner in former time in Iſrael, concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirme all things: a man plucked off his ſhoo, and gaue it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Iſrael.

      * Verſe 8. Therefore the kinſman ſaid vnto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his ſhoo.

      * Verſe 9. And Boaz ſaid vnto the Elders, and vnto all the people, Yee are witneſses this day▪ that I haue bought all that was Elimelechs, and all that was Chilions and Mahlons, of the hand of Naomi.

      * Verſe 10. Moreouer, Ruth the Moabiteſse, the wife of Mahlon, haue I purchaſed to be• my wife, to raiſe vp the name of the dead vpon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: yee are witneſses this day.

      * Verſe 11. And all the people that were in the Gate, and the Elders ſaid, We are witneſses: The Lord make the woman that is come into thine houſe, like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the houſe of Iſrael: And doe thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem.

      * Verſe 12. And let thy houſe bee like the houſe of Pharez (whom Tamar bare vnto Iudah) of the ſeed, which the Lord ſhall giue thee, of this young woman.

      * Verſe 13. So Boaz tooke Ruth, and ſhee was his wife: And when hee went in vnto her, the Lord gaue her conception, and ſhee bare a ſonne.

      * Verſe 14. And the women ſaid vnto Naomi, Bleſſed be the Lord, which hath not left thee this day without a kinſman, that his name may bee famous in Iſrael.

      * Verſe 15. And he ſhall be vnto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nouriſher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loueth thee, which is better to thee thenſeuen ſonnes, hath borne him.

      * Verſe 16. And Naomi tooke the child, and laid it in her boſome, and became nurſe vnto it.

      * Verſe 17. And the women her Neighbours gaue it a name, ſaying, There is a ſonne borne to Naomi: and they called his name Obed; he is the Father of leſſe, the Father of Dauid.

      * Verſe 18. Now theſe are the generations of Pharez; Pharez begat Ram.
